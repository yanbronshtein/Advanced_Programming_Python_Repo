The ones that really mattered.      ,Full of darkness and danger they were.      And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.....because how could the end be happy?       How could the world go back      to the way it was...... when so much bad had happened?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
       "They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one     day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once     was before it fell into decay. ,     The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more     splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their     descent , dearer than the names of their sons.    ,     Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers     asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.    ,     The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered.
