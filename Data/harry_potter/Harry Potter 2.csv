DRACO, It's not my fault the teachers have favorites. ,,,,,
DRACO,That Hermione Granger --,,,,,

LUCIUS MALFOY,As, is the wizard who gave it to you.,,,,
HARRY,Voldemort killed my parents.,,,,,
HARRY,He was nothing more than a murderer.,,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,You must be very brave to mention his name.,,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Or very foolish.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.,,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,And you must be Miss Granger.,,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Yes,,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,And your parents.,,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Muggles,,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Let me see.,,,,,

LUCIUS MALFOY,Busy time at the Ministry, all those extra raids?,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,I do hope they're paying you overtime but judging by the state of this,,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard,,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Clearly.,,,,,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Associating with Muggles.,,,,,

SNAPE,Do you have any idea how serious this is?,,,,,
SNAPE,You have risked the exposure of our world.,,,,,
SNAPE,Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow.,,,,,
SNAPE,that's been on these grounds since before you were born.,,,,,

SNAPE,Silence.,,,,,

HERMIONE,The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.,,,,,
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.,,,,,
PROFESSOR SPROUT,As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet.,,,,,
PROFESSOR SPROUT,But they could knock you out for hours,,,,,

PROFESSOR SPROUT,Flaps tight down,,,,,
PROFESSOR SPROUT,You grasp your Mandrake firmly.,,,,,
PROFESSOR SPROUT,You pull it sharply up out of the pot.,,,,,

PROFESSOR SPROUT,and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.,,,,,
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.,,,,,
SEAMUS,No, he's just fainted.,,,,
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Yes, just leave him there.,,,,
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Right,,,,,

GILDEROY LOCKHART,But I don't talk about that. ,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Now,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I must ask you not to scream.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,It might provoke them.,,,,,
SEAMUS,Cornish pixies?,,,,,

GILDEROY LOCKHART,Laugh if you will,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Let's see what you make of them.,,,,,

RON,What do we do now?,,,,,
HERMIONE,Immobulus!,,,,,
NEVILLE,Why is it always me?,,,,,
WOOD,I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program.,,,,,
WOOD,We're gonna train earlier,,,,,
WOOD,What...? I don't believe it.,,,,,
WOOD,Where you think you're going,,,,,
FLINT,Quidditch practice.,,,,,
WOOD,I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.,,,,,
FLINT,Easy,,,,,
RON,I smell trouble.,,,,,
WOOD,I, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.,,,
WOOD,You've got a new Seeker. Who?,,,,,
HARRY,Malfoy?,,,,,
DRACO,That's right.,,,,,
DRACO,And that's not all that's new this year.,,,,,
RON,Those are Nimbus 2001 s.,,,,,
RON,How did you get those?,,,,,
FLINT,A gift from Draco's father.,,,,,
DRACO,You see, unlike some, my father can afford the best.,,,
HERMIONE,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.,,,,,
HERMIONE,They got in on pure talent.,,,,,
DRACO,No one asked your opinion,,,,,
RON,You'll pay for that one,,,,,
RON,Eat slugs!,,,,,
HERMIONE,You okay,,,,,
HERMIONE,Say something.,,,,,
COLIN,Wow! Can you turn him around,,,,,
HARRY,No, get out of the way.,,,,
HARRY,Let's take him to Hagrid's.,,,,,
HARRY,He'll know what to do.,,,,,
HAGRID,This calls for a specialist's equipment.,,,,,
HAGRID,Nothing to do but wait till it stops,,,,,
HAGRID,Okay.,,,,,
HAGRID,Better out than in.,,,,,
HAGRID,Who was Ron trying to curse,,,,,
HARRY,Malfoy. He called Hermione...,,,,,
HARRY,Well,,,,,
HERMIONE,He called me a Mudblood.,,,,,
HAGRID,He did not.,,,,,
HARRY,What's a Mudblood?,,,,,
HERMIONE,"It means ""dirty blood.",,,,,
HERMIONE,Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Someone with non-magic parents.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Someone like me.,,,,,
HERMIONE,It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.,,,,,
HAGRID,See, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood.,,
HARRY,That's horrible.,,,,,
RON,It's disgusting.,,,,,
HAGRID,And it's codswallop to boot.,,,,,
HAGRID,Dirty blood.,,,,,
HAGRID,Why,,,,,
HAGRID,More to the point,,,,,
HAGRID,Come here.,,,,,
HAGRID,Don't you think on it,,,,,
HAGRID,Don't you think on it for one minute.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Harry, Harry.,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?,,,,,
HARRY,Not really.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Fame is a fickle friend,,,,,

VOICE,Kill!,,,,,
VOICE,Kill!,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry!,,,,,
HARRY,Did you hear it?,,,,,
RON,Hear what?,,,,,
HARRY,That voice.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Voice? What voice?,,,,,
HARRY,I heard it first in Lockhart's office.,,,,,
HARRY,And then again just...,,,,,
VOICE,It's time.,,,,,
HARRY,It's moving.,,,,,
HARRY,I think it's going to kill.,,,,,
RON,Kill?,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry,,,,,
HARRY,Strange.,,,,,
HARRY,I've never seen spiders act like that.,,,,,
RON,I don't like spiders.,,,,,
RON,What's that?,,,,,
HERMIONE,The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. ,,,,,
Enemies of the Heir,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Enemies of the Heir,,,,,
HERMIONE,It's written in blood.,,,,,
HARRY,Oh,,,,,
HARRY,It's Filch's cat.,,,,,
HARRY,It's Mrs. Norris.,,,,,
DRACO,Enemies of the Heir,,,,,
DRACO,You'll be next,,,,,
FILCH,What's going on here?,,,,,
FILCH,Go on. Make way,,,,,
FILCH,Potter?,,,,,
FILCH,What are you...?,,,,,
FILCH,Mrs. Norris?,,,,,
FILCH,You've murdered my cat.,,,,,
HARRY,No. No.,,,,,
FILCH,I'll kill you.,,,,,
FILCH,I'll kill you!,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Argus!,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Argus,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Everyone except you three.,,,,,
BOY,Ravenclaws,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,She's not dead,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,She has been Petrified.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Aghh! Thought so.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,So unlucky I wasn't there.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,But how she has been Petrified,,,,,
FILCH,Ask him.,,,,,
FILCH,It's him that's done it.,,,,,
FILCH,You saw what he wrote on the wall.,,,,,
HARRY,It's not true,,,,,
HARRY,I never touched Mrs. Norris.,,,,,
FILCH,Rubbish.,,,,,
SNAPE,If I might,,,,,
SNAPE,Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.,,,,,
SNAPE,However the circumstances are suspicious.,,,,,
SNAPE,I, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I'm afraid that's my doing,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,You see,,,,,
HERMIONE,That's why Ron and I went looking for him,,,,,
HERMIONE,We'd just found him when he said...,,,,,
SNAPE,Yes,,,,,
HARRY,When I said I wasn't hungry.,,,,,
HARRY,We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Innocent until proven guilty,,,,,
FILCH,My cat has been Petrified.,,,,,
FILCH,I want to see some punishment!,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,We will be able to cure her,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,As I understand it,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,When matured,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,And in the meantime I strongly recommend caution to all.,,,,,
HERMIONE,It's a bit strange,,,,,
HARRY,Strange?,,,,,
HERMIONE,You hear this voice,,,,,
HERMIONE,and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.,,,,,
HARRY,Do you think I should have told them?,,,,,
HARRY,Dumbledore and the others,,,,,
RON,Are you mad?,,,,,
HERMIONE,No, hearing voices isn't a good sign.,,,,
PICTURE,She's right,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Could I have your attention,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Right. Now, we will be transforming animals into water goblets.,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Like so.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,One, three. Vera Verto.,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Now it's your turn.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Who would like to go first?,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Ahh ,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,One, three. Vera Verto.,,,,
RON,Vera Verto!,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,That wand needs replacing,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Yes,,,,,
HERMIONE,Professor I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Very well.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,You all know,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Godric Gryffindor,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Helga Hufflepuff...,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Rowena Ravenclaw,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Salazar Slytherin.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Now,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,One did not.,,,,,
RON,Three guesses who.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,In other words,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Unable to sway the others,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Now,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Though, he sealed it until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school.,,,,
MCGONAGALL,The Heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, were unworthy to study magic.,,,,
HERMIONE,Muggle-borns.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Well , the school has been searched many times.,,,,
MCGONAGALL,No such chamber has been found.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,The Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,It is said to be the home of a monster.,,,,,
RON,Do you think it's true?,,,,,
RON, Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?,,,,,
HERMIONE,Yes. Couldn't you tell? ,,,,,
HERMIONE,McGonagall's worried. ,,,,,
HERMIONE,All the teachers are.,,,,,
HARRY,If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, that means... ,,,,
HERMIONE,The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. ,,,,,
HERMIONE,The question is,,,,,
RON,Let's think. ,,,,,
RON,Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?,,,,,
HERMIONE,If you're talking about Malfoy...,,,,,
RON,Of course. You heard him.,,,,,
RON,You'll be next,,,,,
HERMIONE,I heard him.,,,,,
HERMIONE,But Malfoy,,,,,
HARRY,Maybe Ron's right,,,,,
HARRY,I mean,,,,,
HARRY,The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.,,,,,
RON,Crabbe and Goyle must know.,,,,,
RON,Maybe we could trick them into telling.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Even they aren't that thick.,,,,,
HERMIONE,But there might be another way.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Mind you,,,,,
HERMIONE,Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...,,,,,
HERMIONE,and it'll be dangerous.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Very dangerous.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Here it is.,,,,,
HERMIONE,The Polyjuice Potion.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Properly brewed,,,,,
RON,You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,,,,,
HERMIONE,Yes ,,,,,
RON,Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Exactly.,,,,,
HERMIONE,But it's tricky. ,,,,,
HERMIONE,I've never seen a more complicated potion.,,,,,
HARRY,How long will it take to make?,,,,,
HERMIONE,A month.,,,,,
HARRY,A month?,,,,,
HARRY,But,,,,,
HARRY,if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.,,,,,
HERMIONE,I know.,,,,,
HERMIONE,But it's the only plan we've got.,,,,,
LEE JORDAN,Another goal for Slytherin!,,,,,
LEE JORDAN,They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.,,,,,
SLYTHERINS,Yeah! Yeah!,,,,,
DRACO,All right there,,,,,
WOOD,Watch yourself,,,,,
HARRY,Wood,,,,,
HAGRID,Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger.,,,,,
HAGRID,That's been tampered with,,,,,
RON,I'll stop it.,,,,,
HERMIONE,No! Even with a proper wand,,,,,
HERMIONE,You could hit Harry.,,,,,
DRACO,Training for the ballet,,,,,
DRACO,You'll never catch me,,,,,
HERMIONE,Let's go.,,,,,
LEE JORDAN,Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.,,,,,
LEE JORDAN,Gryffindor wins!,,,,,
HERMIONE,Finite Incantatem!,,,,,
HARRY,Thank you.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Are you okay?,,,,,
HARRY,No. I think my arm is broken.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Not to worry,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I will fix that arm of yours straight away.,,,,,
HARRY,No,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Boy doesn't know what he's saying.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,This won't hurt a bit.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Brackium Emendo!,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Yes, that can sometimes happen but the point is you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken.,
HAGRID,Broken? There's no bones left.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Much more flexible,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,Mr. Malfoy,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,You can go. Out of my way.,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,Should have been brought straight to me.,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,I can mend bones in a heartbeat,,,,,
HERMIONE,You will be able to,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,I'll be able to,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,But it'll be painful.,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,You're in for a rough night,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,Regrowing bones is a nasty business.,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,What do you expect?,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,Pumpkin juice?,,,,,
VOICE,Kill. Kill.!!,,,,,
VOICE,Time to kill..,,,,,
DOBBY,Hello.,,,,,
HARRY,Dobby?,,,,,
DOBBY,Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby.,,,,,
DOBBY,Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.,,,,,
HARRY,It was you. ,,,,,
HARRY,You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.,,,,,
DOBBY,Indeed. Yes,,,,,
HARRY,You nearly got Ron and me expelled.,,,,,
DOBBY,At least you would be away from here.,,,,,
DOBBY,Harry Potter must go home.,,,,,
DOBBY,Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see...,,,,,
HARRY,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?,,,,,
DOBBY,Dobby feels most aggrieved,,,,,
DOBBY,Dobby had to iron his hands.,,,,,
HARRY,You better clear off before my bones come back Dobby,,,,,
DOBBY,Dobby is used to death threats,,,,,
DOBBY,Dobby gets them five times a day at home.,,,,,
HARRY,I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?,,,,,
DOBBY,Not kill you,,,,,
DOBBY,Never kill you.,,,,,
DOBBY,Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.,,,,,
DOBBY,We house-elves were treated like vermin,,,,,
DOBBY,Of course,,,,,
HARRY,Why do you wear that thing,,,,,
DOBBY,This,,,,,
DOBBY,Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.,,,,,
DOBBY,Listen.,,,,,
DOBBY,Listen!,,,,,
DOBBY,Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts.,,,,,
DOBBY,Harry Potter must not stay here...now that history is to repeat itself.,,,,,
HARRY,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?,,,,,
DOBBY,Oahh! I shouldn't have said that.,,,,,
DOBBY,Bad Dobby! Bad!,,,,,
HARRY,Stop it!,,,,,
HARRY,Stop it,,,,,
HARRY,Tell me Dobby when did this happen before?,,,,,
HARRY,Who's doing it now?,,,,,
DOBBY,Dobby cannot say,,,,,
DOBBY,Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.,,,,,
HARRY,No,,,,,
HARRY,Who is it?,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,Put him here.,,,,,
MADAM POMFREY,What happened?,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,There's been another attack.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,I think he's been Petrified,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,What can this mean,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,It means that our students are in great danger.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,What should I tell the staff?,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,The truth.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,It is as we feared,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?,,,,,
RON,Of course.,,,,,
RON,Don't you see?,,,,,
RON,Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.,,,,,
RON,Now he's taught Draco how to do it.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Maybe.,,,,,
HERMIONE,We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.,,,,,
RON,Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight in the middle of the girls' lavatory?,,,,,
RON,Don't you think we'll get caught?,,,,,
HERMIONE,No. No one ever comes in here.,,,,,
RON,Why?,,,,,
HERMIONE,Moaning Myrtle.,,,,,
RON,Who?,,,,,
HERMIONE,Moaning Myrtle.,,,,,
RON,Who's Moaning Myrtle?,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,I'm Moaning Myrtle.,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,I wouldn't expect you to know me.,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,Who would ever talk about ugly,,,,,
HERMIONE,She's a little sensitive.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Gather round!,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Gather round.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Can everybody see me?,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Can you all hear me?,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Excellent.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,In light of the dark events of recent weeks Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club to train you all up.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,In case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,For full details,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Let me introduce my assistant Professor Snape.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I don't want any of you youngsters to worry.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,One.Two. Three!,,,,,
SNAPE,Expelliarmus!,,,,,
HERMIONE,Do you think he's all right?,,,,,
RON,Who cares?,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,An excellent idea to show them that,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,but if you don't mind me saying,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,If I had wanted to stop you,,,,,
SNAPE,Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,An excellent suggestion,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Let's have a volunteer pair. ,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Potter, how about you?,,,,
SNAPE,Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.,,,,,
SNAPE,We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.,,,,,
SNAPE,Might I suggest someone from my own house?,,,,,
SNAPE,Malfoy,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Good luck,,,,,
HARRY,Thank you,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Wands at the ready.,,,,,
DRACO,Scared,,,,,
HARRY,You wish.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,On the count of three cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,We don't want any accidents here.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,One. Two...,,,,,
DRACO,Everte Statum!,,,,,
HARRY,Rictusempra!,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I said disarm only.,,,,,
DRACO,Serpensortia!,,,,,
SNAPE,Don't move,,,,,
SNAPE,I'll get rid of it for you.,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Allow me,,,,,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Alarte Ascendare!,,,,,
SNAPE,Vipera Evanesca.,,,,,
JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY,What are you playing at?,,,,,
RON,You're a Parselmouth?,,,,,
RON,Why didn't you tell us?,,,,,
HARRY,I'm a what?,,,,,
HERMIONE,You can talk to snakes.,,,,,
HARRY,I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.,,,,,
HARRY,Once. But so what?,,,,,
HARRY,I bet loads of people here can do it.,,,,,
HERMIONE,No,,,,,
HERMIONE,It's not a very common gift,,,,,
HERMIONE,This is bad.,,,,,
HARRY,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin...,,,,,
RON,That's what you said to it.,,,,,
HARRY,You were there. You heard me.,,,,,
RON,I heard you speaking Parseltongue.,,,,,
RON,Snake language.,,,,,
HARRY,I spoke a different language?,,,,,
HARRY,But I didn't realize...,,,,,
HARRY,How can I speak a language without knowing I can?,,,,,
HERMIONE,I don't know,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry,,,,,
HERMIONE,There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.,,,,,
HERMIONE,He could talk to snakes too.,,,,,
RON,Exactly.,,,,,
RON,Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson.,,,,,
HARRY,But I'm not.,,,,,
HARRY,I can't be.,,,,,
HERMIONE,He lived a thousand years ago.,,,,,
HERMIONE,For all we know,,,,,
HARRY,I'll see you back in the common room.,,,,,
VOICE,I want blood.,,,,,
VOICE,They all must die.,,,,,
VOICE,Kill. Kill. Kill.,,,,,
VOICE,Time to kill.,,,,,
FILCH,Caught in the act.,,,,,
FILCH,I'll have you out this time,,,,,
FILCH,Mark my words.,,,,,
HARRY,No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...,,,,,
HARRY,Professor I swear I didn't.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,This is out of my hands,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Sherbet Lemon.,,,,,
HARRY,Professor Dumbledore?,,,,,
SORTING HAT,Bee in your bonnet,,,,,
HARRY,I...I..I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.,,,,,
SORTING HAT,Yes. You were particularly difficult to place.,,,,,
SORTING HAT,But I stand by what I said last year.,,,,,
SORTING HAT,You would have done well in Slytherin.,,,,,
HARRY,You're wrong.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Harry?,,,,,
HARRY,Professor.,,,,,
HARRY,Your bird...There was nothing I could do.,,,,,
HARRY,He just caught fire.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,And about time too.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,He's been looking dreadful for days.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Pity you had to see him on a burning day.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Fawkes is a phoenix,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,They burst into flame when it is time for them to die...,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,and then they are reborn from the ashes.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Fascinating creatures,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,They can carry immensely heavy loads.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Their tears have healing powers.,,,,,
HAGRID,Professor Dumbledore,,,,,
HAGRID,Wait! Listen!,,,,,
HAGRID,Professor Dumbledore, it wasn't Harry.,,,,
HAGRID,I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Hagriiid!! Relax.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.,,,,,
HAGRID,Of course you don't.,,,,,
HAGRID,Ohh! Oww! Right. Well,,,,,
HAGRID,I'll just wait outside,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Yes.,,,,,
HARRY,You don't think it was me,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,No,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,But I must ask you is there something you wish to tell me?,,,,,
HARRY,No,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Very well,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Off you go.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Everything's set. ,,,,,
HERMIONE,We just need a bit of who you're changing into.,,,,,
HARRY,Crabbe and Goyle.,,,,,
HERMIONE,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.,,,,,
RON,How?,,,,,
HERMIONE,I've got it all worked out.,,,,,
HERMIONE,I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Simple,,,,,
HERMIONE,Now,,,,,
RON,Whose hair are you ripping out,,,,,
HERMIONE,I've already got mine.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.,,,,,
HERMIONE,I got this off her robes.,,,,,
HERMIONE,I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.,,,,,
HARRY,Ron,,,,,
RON,Yeah. Right.,,,,,
HARRY,Wingardium Leviosa.,,,,,
CRABBE,Cool. Umm..um.,,,,,
RON,How thick could you get?,,,,,
HARRY,Come on,,,,,
HERMIONE,We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Add the hairs.,,,,,
RON,Essence of Crabbe.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Cheers.,,,,,
RON,I think I'm gonna be sick.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Me too.,,,,,
RON,Harry?,,,,,
HARRY,Ron.,,,,,
RON,Bloody hell!,,,,,
HARRY,We still sound like ourselves.,,,,,
HARRY,You need to sound more like Crabbe.,,,,,
RON,Bloody hell.,,,,,
HARRY,Excellent.,,,,,
RON,But where's Hermione?,,,,,
HERMIONE,I...I don't think I'm going.,,,,,
HERMIONE,You go on without me.,,,,,
HARRY,Hermione,,,,,
HERMIONE,Just go. You're wasting time.,,,,,
HARRY,Come on.,,,,,
HARRY,I think the Slytherin common room's this way.,,,,,
PERCY,Excuse me.,,,,,
RON,What are you doing d...?,,,,,
RON,I mean,,,,,
PERCY,I happen to be a school prefect.,,,,,
PERCY,You, have no business wandering the corridors at night.,,,,
PERCY,What are your names again?,,,,,
HARRY,I'm...,,,,,
DRACO,Crabbe, where have you been?,,,,
DRACO,Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?,,,,,
DRACO,Why are you wearing glasses?,,,,,
HARRY,Ah- um.. Reading.,,,,,
DRACO,Reading?,,,,,
DRACO,I didn't know you could read.,,,,,
DRACO,And what are you doing down here,,,,,
PERCY,Mind your attitude,,,,,
DRACO,Well,,,,,
DRACO,You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods,,,,,
DRACO,They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them.,,,,,
DRACO,What's wrong with you,,,,,
RON,Stomachache.,,,,,
DRACO,I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.,,,,,
DRACO,I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up.,,,,,
DRACO,Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.,,,,,
HARRY,You're wrong!,,,,,
DRACO,What?,,,,,
DRACO,You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?,,,,,
DRACO,Well? Do you?,,,,,
HARRY,Harry Potter?,,,,,
DRACO,Good one,,,,,
DRACO,You're absolutely right.,,,,,
DRACO,Saint Potter.,,,,,
DRACO,And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?,,,,,
HARRY,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.,,,,,
DRACO,You know I don't,,,,,
DRACO,I told you yesterday.,,,,,
DRACO,How many times do I have to tell you?,,,,,
DRACO,Is this yours?,,,,,
DRACO,But my father did say this:,,,,,
DRACO,It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened.,,,,,
DRACO,He wouldn't tell me who opened it.,,,,,
DRACO,Only that they were expelled.,,,,,
DRACO,The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened,,,,,
DRACO,So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.,,,,,
DRACO,As for me I hope it's Granger.,,,,,
DRACO,What's the matter with you two?,,,,,
DRACO,You're acting very odd.,,,,,
HARRY,It's his stomachache.,,,,,
HARRY,Calm down.,,,,,
RON,Scar!,,,,,
HARRY,Hair!,,,,,
DRACO,Hey! Where are you going?,,,,,
RON,That was close.,,,,,
HARRY,Hermione,,,,,
HARRY,We've got loads to tell you.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Go away.,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,Wait till you see. It's awful.,,,,,
HARRY,Hermione?,,,,,
HARRY,Are you okay?,,,,,
HERMIONE,Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?,,,,,
HERMIONE,It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Look at my face.,,,,,
RON,Look at your tail.,,,,,
RON,Have you spoken to Hermione?,,,,,
HARRY,She should be out of hospital in a few days when she stops coughing up fur balls.,,,,,
HARRY,What's this?,,,,,
RON,Yuck!,,,,,
HARRY,Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,Ohh-Uhh..Come to throw something else at me?,,,,,
HARRY,Why would I throw something at you?,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,Don't ask me. Here I am,,,,,
RON,But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.,,,,,
RON,I mean,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,SURE! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it.,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,Ten points if you get it through her stomach!,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,Fifty points if it goes through her head!,,,,,
HARRY,But who threw it at you,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,I don't know. I didn't see them.,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,I was just sitting in the U-bend,,,,,
MOANING MYRTLE,Whoo-oooh-whoooo...,,,,,
HARRY,"""Tom Marvolo Riddle.""",,,,,
HARRY,My name is Harry Potter.,,,,,
DIARY,Hello Harry Potter,,,,,
HARRY,Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?,,,,,
DIARY,Yes.,,,,,
HARRY,Can you tell me?,,,,,
DIARY,No. But I can show you.,,,,,
DIARY,Let me take you back fifty years ago.,,,,,
DIARY,13th June..,,,,,
HARRY,Excuse me. ,,,,,
HARRY,Could you tell me what's going on here?,,,,,
HARRY,Are you Tom Riddle?,,,,,
HARRY,Hello,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Riddle! Come.,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,Professor Dumbledore.,,,,,
HARRY,Dumbledore?,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,Yes,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,I had to see for myself if the rumors were true.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,I'm afraid they are,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,They are true.,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,About the school as well?,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,I don't have a home to go to.,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, professor?,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,I understand, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,Sir, if the person responsible was caught...,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Is there something you wish to tell me?,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,No,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Very well,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,Good night,,,,,
HAGRID,Let's get you out of there.,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,Evening,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,I'm going to have to turn you in Hagrid,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,I don't think you meant it to kill anyone...,,,,,
HAGRID,You can't. You don't understand.,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. ,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.,,,,,
HAGRID,It wasn't him.,,,,,
HAGRID,Aragog never killed no one. Never.,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,Monsters don't make good pets,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,Now,,,,,
HAGRID,No!,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,Stand aside,,,,,
HAGRID,No!,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,Cistem Aperio!,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,Arania Exumai!,,,,,
HAGRID,Aragog! Aragog!,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,I can't let you go.,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,They'll have your wand for this,,,,,
TOM RIDDLE,You'll be expelled.,,,,,
HARRY,Hagrid!,,,,,
HARRY,HAAGRIIID!,,,,,
HARRY,Wow!,,,,,
HARRY,It was Hagrid. ,,,,,
HARRY,Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.,,,,,
HERMIONE,It can't be Hagrid.,,,,,
HERMIONE,It just can't be.,,,,,
RON,We don't even know this Tom Riddle.,,,,,
RON,He sounds like a dirty,,,,,
HARRY,The monster had killed somebody,,,,,
HARRY,What would any of us have done?,,,,,
HERMIONE,Look,,,,,
HERMIONE,Why don't we just go and ask him about it?,,,,,
RON,That would be a cheerful visit.,,,,,
RON,Hello,,,,,

HARRY-RON-HERMIONE,No.,,,,,
HARRY,What's that you've got,,,,,
HAGRID,It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.,,,,,
HAGRID,For the Mandrakes,,,,,
HAGRID,Now, they've still got a bit of growing to do.,,,,
HAGRID,But once their acne's cleared up,,,,,
HAGRID,In the meantime, you three had best be looking after yourselves.,,,,
HAGRID,All right?,,,,,
HAGRID,Hello,,,,,
NEVILLE,Harry, but you'd better come.,,,,
NEVILLE,Come on!,,,,,
HERMIONE,It had to be a Gryffindor.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Nobody else knows our password.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Unless it wasn't a student.,,,,,
RON,Whoever it was,,,,,
HARRY,And they found it.,,,,,
HARRY,Tom Riddle's diary is gone.,,,,,
WOOD,All right,,,,,
WOOD,We play our game,,,,,
WOOD,We're stronger,,,,,
FRED,Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.,,,,,
WOOD,Well,,,,,
WOOD,Professor McGonagall.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,This match has been canceled.,,,,,
WOOD,We can't cancel Quidditch.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Silence,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Potter,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,There's something the both of you have to see.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,I warn you.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,This could be a wee bit of a shock.,,,,,
RON,Hermione!,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,She was found near the library along with this.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Does it mean anything to either of you?,,,,,
HARRY,No.,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Could I have your attention,,,,,

RON,Harry,,,,,
RON,Harry,,,,,
HARRY,Shush!,,,,,
RON,Can we go back now?,,,,,
HARRY,Come on.,,,,,
ARAGOG,Who is it?,,,,,
HARRY,Don't panic.,,,,,
ARAGOG,Hagrid?,,,,,
ARAGOG,Is that you?,,,,,
HARRY,We're friends of Hagrid's.,,,,,
HARRY,And you?,,,,,
HARRY,You're Aragog,,,,,
ARAGOG,Yes.,,,,,
ARAGOG,Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.,,,,,
HARRY,He's in trouble. Up at the school,,,,,
HARRY,They think it's Hagrid.,,,,,
HARRY,They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.,,,,,
ARAGOG,That's a lie.,,,,,
ARAGOG,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.,,,,,
HARRY,Then you're not the monster?,,,,,
ARAGOG,No.,,,,,
ARAGOG,The monster was born in the castle.,,,,,
ARAGOG,I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.,,,,,
RON,Harry.,,,,,
HARRY,But if you're not the monster,,,,,
ARAGOG,We do not speak of it.,,,,,
ARAGOG,It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.,,,,,
HARRY,But have you seen it?,,,,,
ARAGOG,I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me.,,,,,
ARAGOG,The girl was discovered in a bathroom.,,,,,
ARAGOG,When I was accused,,,,,
RON,Harry!,,,,,
HARRY,What?,,,,,
HARRY,Well,,,,,
HARRY,We'll just go.,,,,,
ARAGOG,Go?,,,,,
ARAGOG,I think not.,,,,,
ARAGOG,My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command.,,,,,
ARAGOG,But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst.,,,,,
ARAGOG,Goodbye,,,,,
RON,Can we panic now?,,,,,
RON,Know any spells?,,,,,
HARRY,One,,,,,
RON,Where's Hermione when you need her?,,,,,
HARRY,Let's go!,,,,,
HARRY,Arania Exumai!,,,,,
HARRY,Go!,,,,,
RON,Glad we're out of there.,,,,,
HARRY,Arania Exumai!,,,,,
RON,Thanks for that.,,,,,
HARRY,Don't mention it.,,,,,
HARRY,Get us out of here.,,,,,
HARRY,Now!,,,,,
HARRY,Come on!,,,,,
HARRY,Come on,,,,,
HARRY,Come on! Go!,,,,,
HARRY,Get us in the air.,,,,,
RON,The flying gear's jammed!,,,,,
HARRY,Come on! Pull!,,,,,
RON,I'm trying!,,,,,
RON,Follow the spiders!,,,,,
RON,Follow the spiders.,,,,,
RON,If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,,,,,
RON,I mean,,,,,
RON,What have we found out?,,,,,
HARRY,We know one thing.,,,,,
HARRY,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.,,,,,
HARRY,He was innocent.,,,,,
HARRY,Wish you were here,,,,,
HARRY,We need you.,,,,,
HARRY,Now more than ever.,,,,,
RON,What's that?,,,,,
HARRY,Ron...,,,,,
HARRY,This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.,,,,,
HARRY,Come on.,,,,,
HARRY,Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk.,,,,,
