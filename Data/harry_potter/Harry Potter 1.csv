Hagrid,Nobody,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Except you.,,,,,,,
Harry,Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?,,,,,,,

Madam Hooch,Oh, it's a broken wrist.,,,,,,
Madam Hooch,Poor boy. Come on now,,,,,,,
Madam Hooch,Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.,,,,,,,
Madam Hooch,Understand? If I see a single broom in the air the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say,,,,,,,
Malfoy,Did you see his face?,,,,,,,
Malfoy,Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze,,,,,,,
Harry,Give it here,,,,,,,
Malfoy,No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.,,,,,,,
Malfoy,How about on the roof?,,,,,,,
Malfoy,What's the matter,,,,,,,
Malfoy,Bit beyond your reach?,,,,,,,
Hermione,Harry,,,,,,,
Hermione,You heard what Madam Hooch said.,,,,,,,
Hermione,Besides,,,,,,,
Hermione,What an idiot.,,,,,,,
Harry,Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom!,,,,,,,
Malfoy,Is that so?,,,,,,,
Malfoy,Have it your way,,,,,,,
Boy,Nice going,,,,,,,
Boy,That was wicked,,,,,,,
McGonagall,Harry Potter!,,,,,,,
McGonagall,Follow me.,,,,,,,
McGonagall,You wait here.,,,,,,,
McGonagall,Professor Quirrell,,,,,,,
McGonagall,Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?,,,,,,,
Quirrell,Oh, of course.,,,,,,
McGonagall,Potter,,,,,,,
McGonagall,Wood,,,,,,,
Sir Nicholas,Have you heard? ,,,,,,,
Sir Nicholas,Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. ,,,,,,,
Sir Nicholas,I always knew hed do well.,,,,,,,
Ron,Seeker? ,,,,,,,
Ron,But first years never make their house teams! ,,,,,,,
Ron,You must be the youngest Quidditch player in,,,,,,,
Harry ,A century,,,,,,,
Fred  ,Hey, Harry, ,,,,,
Fred  ,Wood's just told us!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Fred and George are on the team,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Beaters.,,,,,,,
George  ,Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. ,,,,,,,
George  ,Can't make any promises,,,,,,,
George  ,Rough game,,,,,,,
Fred  ,Brutal. ,,,,,,,
Fred  ,But no one's died in years. ,,,,,,,
Fred  ,Someone will vanish occasionally  ,,,,,,,
George  ,But they'll turn up in a month or two!!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Oh, Harry, ,,,,,
Ron  ,Quidditch is great. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Best game there is! ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,And you'll be great,,,,,,,
Harry  ,But I've never even played Quidditch. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,What if I make a fool of myself?,,,,,,,
Hermione,You won't make a fool of yourself. ,,,,,,,
Hermione,It's in your blood.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Whoa. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Harry, too.,,,,,,
Harry  ,I-I didn't know.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,I'm telling you,,,,,,,
Ron  ,She knows more about you than you do.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Who doesn't?,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Ahh!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,What's happening?,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,The staircases change,,,,,,,
Harry,Let's go this way.,,,,,,,
Ron ,Before the staircase moves again. ,,,,,,,
Ron,Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?,,,,,,,
Hermione,We're not supposed to be here. ,,,,,,,
Hermione,This is the 3rd floor. ,,,,,,,
Hermione,It's forbidden.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Let's go.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,It's Filch's cat!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Run! Quick,,,,,,,
Harry,It's locked!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,That's it,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Oh,,,,,,,
Hermione,Alohomora,,,,,,,
Hermione,Get in,,,,,,,
Ron,Alohomora?,,,,,,,
Hermione ,Standard book of spells,,,,,,,
Filch,Anyone here,,,,,,,
Hermione ,Filch is gone.,,,,,,,
Ron ,Probably thinks this door's locked.,,,,,,,
Hermione , It was locked.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,And for good reason. ,,,,,,,
All  ,AHHHHHHH! ,,,,,,,
Ron ,What do they think they're doing?? ,,,,,,,
Ron ,Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.,,,,,,,
Hermione , You don't use your eyes,,,,,,,
Hermione ,Didn't you see what it was standing on?,,,,,,,
Ron  ,I wasn't looking at its feet! ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Or maybe you didn't notice,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,It was standing on a trap door. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Which means it wasn't there by accident. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,It's guarding something.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Guarding something?,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,That's right. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Now, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled!,,,,,
Ron  ,She needs to sort out her priorities!,,,,,,,
Oliver ,Quidditch is easy enough to understand. ,,,,,,,
Oliver ,Each time has seven players, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. ,,,,,
Oliver ,There are three kinds of balls. ,,,,,,,
Oliver ,This one's called the Quaffle.,,,,,,,
Oliver ,Now,,,,,,,
Oliver ,The keeper, defends the hoops. ,,,,,,
Oliver ,With me so far?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I think so. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,What are those?,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,You better take this. ,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,Careful now,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,Eh, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. ,,,,,
Harry,What was that?,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,Bludger. Nasty little buggers. ,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,But you are a Seeker.,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,The only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. ,,,,,,,
Harry ,I like this ball.,,,,,,,
Oliver ,Ah,,,,,,,
Oliver ,Just wait. ,,,,,,,
Oliver ,It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,What do I do with it?,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,You catch it...before the other team's seeker. ,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,You catch this,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,You catch this, and we win.,,,,,,
Harry  ,Whoa.,,,,,,,
Flitwick,One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. ,,,,,,,
Flitwick,Uh,,,,,,,
Flitwick,Now, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? ,,,,,
Flitwick,The swish and flick. Everyone. ,,,,,,,
Class,The swish and flick. ,,,,,,,
Flitwick,Good. ,,,,,,,
Flitwick,And enunciate. ,,,,,,,
Flitwick,Wingardium Leviosa. ,,,,,,,
Flitwick,Off you go then.,,,,,,,
Draco  ,Wingardium Levio-saaa.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Wingardrium Leviosar. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Stop, stop.,,,,,,
Hermione  ,You're going to take someone's eye out. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Besides,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,It's Leviosa,,,,,,,
Ron  ,You do it then if you're so clever. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Go on,,,,,,,
Hermione,Wingardium Leviosa.,,,,,,,
Flitwick  ,Oh,,,,,,,
Flitwick  ,See here,,,,,,,
Flitwick  ,Ms. Granger's done it! ,,,,,,,
Flitwick  ,Oh,,,,,,,
Seamus  ,Wingard Levosa. Wingardly Lev... ,,,,,,,
Flitwick  ,Whooaaa! Ooh.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I think we're going to need another feather over here,,,,,,,
Ron  ,It's Leviosa,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Honestly,,,,,,,
Ron  ,No wonder she hasn't got any friends!,,,,,,,
Harry,I think she heard you.,,,,,,,
Harry,Where's Hermione?,,,,,,,
Neville,Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. ,,,,,,,
Neville,She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.,,,,,,,
Quirrell,TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! ,,,,,,,
Quirrell,T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! ,,,,,,,
Quirrell,Thought you ought to know. ,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!,,,,,,,
Dumbledore, Everyone will please,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,Now,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.,,,,,,,
Girl  ,Hufflepuff,,,,,,,
Boy  ,Stay together!,,,,,,,
Percy  ,Gryffindors...keep up please. ,,,,,,,
Percy  ,And stay alert!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,How could a troll get in?,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Not by itself. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Trolls are really stupid. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Probably people playing jokes.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,What?,,,,,,,
Harry ,Hermione! ,,,,,,,
Harry ,She doesn't know!,,,,,,,
Ron,I think the troll's left the dungeon.,,,,,,,
Harry ,It's going into the Girl's Bathroom!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Hermione,,,,,,,
Hermione,Help! Help!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Hey,,,,,,,
Hermione ,Ahhh! Help!,,,,,,,
Harry ,Whooa! Whoa,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Do something!,,,,,,,
Ron ,What?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Anything! ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Hurry up!,,,,,,,
Hermione,Swish and flick!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Wingardium Leviosa! ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Cool!,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Is it...dead?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I don't think so. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Just knocked out. ,,,,,,,
Harry  , Ew. Troll bogies.,,,,,,,
McGonagall ,Oh! Oh,,,,,,,
McGonagall ,E-Explain yourselves,,,,,,,
Ron and Harry,Well,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,It's my fault,,,,,,,
McGonagall , Ms. Granger?,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,I went looking for the troll. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,But I was wrong. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,I'd probably be dead.,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. ,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part and I am very disappointed in you Ms. Granger. ,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. ,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. ,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,Not many first year students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. ,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,5 points...will be awarded to each of you. ,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,For sheer dumb luck. ,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,Perhaps you ought to go...,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,M-might wake up...heh.Ahh! Hehe....,,,,,,,
Harry,Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.,,,,,,,
Ron,Mind you,,,,,,,
Harry,Mind you,,,,,,,
Ron,What are friends for?,,,,,,,
Ron,Take a bit of toast,,,,,,,
Hermione,Ron's right,,,,,,,
Hermione,You're gonna need your strength today.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I'm not hungry.,,,,,,,
Snape  ,Good luck today,,,,,,,
Snape  ,Then again, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin.,,,,,,
Harry  ,That explains the blood.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Blood?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Listen, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. ,,,,,,
Harry  ,But, that's why he's limping.,,,,,,
Hermione , But why would anyone go near that dog?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,The day I was at Gringotts,,,,,,,
Harry  , He said it was Hogwarts' business,,,,,,,
Hermione ,So you're saying...,,,,,,,
Harry ,That's what the dog's guarding. ,,,,,,,
Harry ,That's what Snape wants.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Bit early for mail,,,,,,,
Harry  ,But I-I never get mail.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Let's open it.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,It's a broomstick!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Thats not just a broomstick,,,,,,,
Ron  ,It's a Nimbus 2000!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,But who...?,,,,,,,
OIiver  ,Scared,,,,,,,
Harry  ,A little.,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,That's all right. ,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,I felt the same way before my first game.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,What happened?,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,Er,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. ,,,,,,,
Oliver  ,Woke up in the hospital a week later.,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,Hello,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.,,,,,,,
Madam Hooch,Now,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. ,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,Remember,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,Angelina Johnson scores! ,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,10 points for Gryffindor! ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Yes! Whoa!,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,Well done!,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan,Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.,,,,,,,
Harry ,Yes!,,,,,,,
Lee Jordan, Another 10 points to Gryffindor! ,,,,,,,
Gryffindors  ,Yay!,,,,,,,
Flint  ,Give me that! ,,,,,,,
Crowd  ,Boooo!!,,,,,,,
Flint,Take that side!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Whoa! Whooa!,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,What's going on with Harry's broomstick?,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,It's Snape! ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,He's jinxing the broom!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Jinxing the broom? ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,What do we do?,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Leave it to me. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Come on,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Lacarnum Inflamarae.,,,,,,,
Man  ,Fire! You're on fire!,,,,,,,
Snape  ,What? Oh!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Go!,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Go go go!,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Looks like he's gonna be sick.,,,,,,,
Lee  Jordan,He's got the Snitch! ,,,,,,,
Lee  Jordan,Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!,,,,,,,
Madam Hooch ,Gryffindor win!,,,,,,,
All  ,YAY!,,,,,,,
Draco  ,No!,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Yes!,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Whoo-hoo!,,,,,,,
Crowd  ,Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! ,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Nonsense. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?,,,,,,,
Harry ,Who knows. ,,,,,,,
Harry ,Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Who told you 'bout Fluffy?,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Fluffy?,,,,,,,
Hermione,That thing has a name?,,,,,,,
Hagrid , Well,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,He's mine. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Yes?,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Shouldn'ta said that.  No more questions!,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Don't ask any more questions. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,That's top secret,,,,,,,
Harry  ,But Hagrid, Snape's trying to steal it!,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Codswallop. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Hogwarts teacher or not,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,I've read all about them. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,You have to keep eye contact. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,And Snape wasn't blinking.,,,,,,,
Harry ,Exactly.,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Now, all three of you. ,,,,,,
Hagrid,You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid,It's dangerous.,,,,,,,
Hagrid,What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.,,,,,,,
Harry ,Nicholas Flamel?,,,,,,,
Hagrid,I shouldn't have said that. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid,I should not have said that. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid,I should not have said that. ,,,,,,,
Harry,Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?,,,,,,,
Hermione,I don't know.,,,,,,,
Harry,Knight to E-5.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Queen to E-5.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,That's totally barbaric!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,That's wizard's chess. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,I see you've packed.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,See you haven't.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Change of plans. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother,,,,,,,
Ron  ,He's studying dragons there!,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Good. You can help Harry,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,We've looked a hundred times!,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Not in the restricted section...,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Happy Christmas.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,I think we've had a bad influence on her.,,,,,,,
Ron,Harry,,,,,,,
Ron,Come on Harry,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Happy Christmas,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Happy Christmas,,,,,,,
Harry  ,What are you wearing?,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Oh,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Looks like you've got one too!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I've got presents?,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Yeah!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Oh! ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,There they are. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Your father left this in my possession before he died.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,It is time it was returned to you.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Use it well.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,What is it?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Some kind of...cloak.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Well,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Put it on.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Whoa!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,My body's gone!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,I know what that is! ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,That's an invisibility cloak!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I'm invisible??,,,,,,,
Ron,They're really rare. ,,,,,,,
Ron,I wonder who gave it to you.,,,,,,,
Harry,There was no name. ,,,,,,,
Harry,It just said,,,,,,,
Harry,Famous fire eaters...,,,,,,,
Harry,15th Century Fiends...Flamel...,,,,,,,
Harry,Nicholas Flamel...where are you?,,,,,,,
Man  ,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!,,,,,,,
Filch,Who's there?! ,,,,,,,
Filch,I know you're in there. ,,,,,,,
Filch,You can't hide. ,,,,,,,
Filch,Who is it? ,,,,,,,
Filch,Show yourself!,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,Severus...I-I thought...,,,,,,,
Snape  ,You don't want me as your enemy,,,,,,,
Quirrell , W-what do you m-mean?,,,,,,,
Snape  ,You know perfectly well what I mean. ,,,,,,,
Snape  ,We'll have another chat soon...,,,,,,,
Snape  ,When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.,,,,,,,
Filch  ,Oh, in the Restricted Section. ,,,,,,
Filch  ,It's still hot. ,,,,,,,
Filch  ,That means there's a student out of bed.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Mum? Dad? ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Ron! You've really got to see this! ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Ron! You've got to see this! ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Ron, come on. Get out of bed!,,,,,,
Ron ,Why?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,There's something you've got to see. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Now,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Come on. Come. Come look,,,,,,,
Ron  ,I only see us.,,,,,,,
Harry,Look in properly. Go on. ,,,,,,,
Harry,Stand there. There. ,,,,,,,
Harry,You see them,,,,,,,
Harry,Thats my dad,,,,,,,
Ron  ,That's me! Only,,,,,,,
Ron  ,I'm holding the Quidditch cup! ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,And bloody hell,,,,,,,
Ron  ,I look good. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Harry,,,,,,,
Harry  ,How can it? ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Both my parents are dead.,,,,,,,
George  ,Do you like yours,,,,,,,
George  ,Ron?,,,,,,,
Ron,I'll be right back.,,,,,,,
Ron,Wanna play chess?,,,,,,,
Harry,No.,,,,,,,
Ron,Wanna go and visit Hagrid?,,,,,,,
Harry,No.,,,,,,,
Ron,Harry, but don't.,,,,,,
Ron,There's something not right about that mirror.,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,Back again,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,I see that you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. ,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,I trust by now you realize what it does. ,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,Let me give you a clue. ,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself,,,,,,,
Harry  ,So,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Whatever we want?,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,Yes...and no. ,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,Now you, you see them standing beside you. ,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,But remember this,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. ,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,Men have wasted away in front of it,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,It does not do to dwell on dreams, and forget to live.,,,,,,
Hermione,Look at you,,,,,,,
Hermione,Pathetic!,,,,,,,
Hermione,We've got final exams coming up soon.,,,,,,,
Ron,I'm ready. Ask me any question.,,,,,,,
Hermione,Alright,,,,,,,
Ron,I forgot.,,,,,,,
Hermoine,And what, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?,,,,,,
Ron,Copy off you.,,,,,,,
Hermoine,No,,,,,,,
Hermoine,Besides, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an Anti Cheating Spell.,,,,,,
Ron,That's insulting! ,,,,,,,
Ron,It's as if they don't trust us! Dumbledore again!,,,,,,,
Ron,Leg-Locker Curse?,,,,,,,
Harry,Malfoy.,,,,,,,
Ron,You have got to start standing up to people,,,,,,,
Neville,How? I can barely stand at all!,,,,,,,
Seamus,I'll do the countercurse!,,,,,,,
Neville,No,,,,,,,
Neville,You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!,,,,,,,
Seamus,I don't appreciate the insinuation,,,,,,,
Seamus,Besides,,,,,,,
Harry,I found him!,,,,,,,
Ron,Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945.,,,,,,,
Harry,Go on!,,,,,,,
Ron,For the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...and his work on alchemy with his partner,,,,,,,
Harry,I knew the name sound familiar.,,,,,,,
Harry,I read it on the train that day.,,,,,,,
Hermione,Follow me!,,,,,,,
Neville,Hey! Wait! Where are you going?,,,,,,,
Neville,What about the countercurse?,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,I had you looking in the wrong section! ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,How could I be so stupid? ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,This is light?,,,,,,,
Hermione ,Of course! Here it is! ,,,,,,,
Hermione ,Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!,,,,,,,
Ron and Harry  ,The what?,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Honestly,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. ,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
McGonagall,No, Mr. Malfoy. ,,,,,,
McGonagall,You see, you too were out of bed after hours. ,,,,,,
McGonagall,You will join your classmates in detention.,,,,,,,
Filch  ,A pity they let the old punishments die. ,,,,,,,
Filch  ,There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. ,,,,,,,
Filch  ,God,,,,,,,
Filch  ,You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight.,,,,,,,
Filch  ,He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.,,,,,,,
Filch  ,A sorry lot this,,,,,,,
Filch  ,Oh, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?,,,,
Hagrid ,Norbert's gone.,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Well, isn't it? ,,,,,,
Hermione  ,He'll be with his own kind.,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Yeah,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,What if the other dragons are mean to him?,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,He's only a baby,,,,,,,
Filch  ,Oh, pull yourself together, man. ,,,,,
Filch  ,You're going into the forest,,,,,,,
Filch  ,Got to have your wits about you.,,,,,,,
Malfoy,The forest? I thought that was a joke! ,,,,,,,
Malfoy,We can't go in there. ,,,,,,,
Malfoy,Students aren't allowed.,,,,,,,
Malfoy, And there are...werewolves!,,,,,,,
Filch , There's more than werewolves in those trees,,,,,,,
Filch ,You can be sure of that.,,,,,,,
Filch ,Nighty-night.,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,Right. Let's go.,,,,,,,
Harry , Hagrid,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,What we're here for. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,See that? That's unicorn's blood,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,I found one dead a few weeks ago. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Now,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,So,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Ron, you'll come with me.,,,,,,
Ron,Okay.,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,And Harry you'll go with Malfoy. ,,,,,,,
Malfoy,Okay. Then I get Fang!,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,Fine. Just so you know,,,,,,,
Malfoy,You wait till my father hears about this. ,,,,,,,
Malfoy,This is servant's stuff.,,,,,,,
Harry ,If I didn't know better, I'd say you were scared.,,,,,,
Malfoy,Scared,,,,,,,
Malfoy,Did you hear that? ,,,,,,,
Malfoy,Come on,,,,,,,
Harry ,What is it,,,,,,,
Malfoy,AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! HELP!!!!!,,,,,,,
Firenze  ,Harry Potter,,,,,,,
Firenze  ,You are known to many creatures here. ,,,,,,,
Firenze  ,The forest is not safe at this time. ,,,,,,,
Firenze  ,Especially for you.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,But what was that thing you saved me from?,,,,,,,
Firenze ,A monstrous creature. ,,,,,,,
Firenze ,It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. ,,,,,,,
Firenze ,Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. ,,,,,,,
Firenze ,But at a terrible price. ,,,,,,,
Firenze ,You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips,,,,,,,
Firenze ,A cursed life.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,But who would choose such a life?,,,,,,,
Firenze  ,Can you think of no one?,,,,,,,
Harry , Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...,,,,,,,
Harry ,that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?,,,,,,,
Firenze  ,Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,The Sorcerer's Stone.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Harry!,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,Hello there,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,You all right there,,,,,,,
Firenze  ,Harry Potter,,,,,,,
Firenze  ,You're safe now. Good luck.,,,,,,,
Hermione,You mean, right now, in the forest?,,,,,
Harry  ,But he's weak. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,He's living off the unicorns. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Don't you see? We had it wrong. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Snape doesn't want the stone for himself,,,,,,,
Harry  ,With the Elixir of Life,,,,,,,
Harry  ,He'll He'll come back. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,But if he comes back, do you?,,,,,,
Harry , I think if he'd had the chance,,,,,,,
Ron , And to think,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Hang on a minute.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,We're forgetting one thing. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?,,,,,,,
Hermione  , Dumbledore! ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,As long as Dumbledore's around,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,As long as Dumbledore's around,,,,,,,
Hermione , I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Speak for yourself.,,,,,,,
Ron  , All right there,,,,,,,
Harry  ,My scar. It keeps burning.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,It's happened before.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Not like this.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Perhaps you should see the nurse.,,,,,,,
Harry , I think it's a warning.,,,,,,,
Harry , It means dangers coming. Uhh!  ,,,,,,,
Harry ,Oh. Of course!,,,,,,,
Hermione , What is it?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I mean,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Why didn't I see it before? ,,,,,,,

Hagrid  ,He kept his hood up.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,The stranger, you and he must have talked.,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,Well,,,,,,,
Hagrid  ,I told him. I said," a dragon's gonna be no problem.""""""",,,,,,
Harry , And did he seem interested in Fluffy?,,,,,,,
Hagrid , Well,,,,,,,
Hagrid , How often do you come across a three headed dog,,,,,,,
Hagrid ,But I told him. I said,,,,,,,
Hagrid , Take Fluffy," just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""""""",,,,,,
Hagrid,  I shouldn't have told you that.,,,,,,,
Hagrid, Where you going?! Wait!,,,,,,,
Harry , We have to see Professor Dumbledore,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. ,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,He's gone?! Now? ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,But this is important! ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,It's about...the Sorcerer's Stone.,,,,,,,
McGonagall ,How do you know?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Someone's going to try and steal it.,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,I don't know how you three found out about the stone,,,,,,,
McGonagall  ,Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,It was Snape,,,,,,,
Hermione , And with Dumbledore gone,,,,,,,
Snape , Good afternoon. ,,,,,,,
Snape ,Now,,,,,,,

Snape  ,You want to be careful.,,,,,,,
Snape  ,People will think you're up to something.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Now what do we do?,,,,,,,
Harry,We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Trevor.,,,,,,,

Neville  , I-I'll fight you.,,,,,,,

Ron  ,Wait a minute...he's.... ,,,,,,,
Harry,Snoring,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Snape's already been here. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,He's put a spell on the harp.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Uh. It's got horrible breath!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,We have to move its paw.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,What?!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Come on! Okay. Push! ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I'll go first. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Don't follow until I give you a sign.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,If something bad happens,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Does it seem a bit...quiet to you?,,,,,,,
Hermione ,The harp. It stopped playing.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Ew! Yuck! Ugh. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Jump! Go! ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Ahh! Whoa. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Lucky this plant-thing is here,,,,,,,
Harry ,Whoa! Oh. Ahh!,,,,,,,
Hermione ,Stop moving,,,,,,,
Hermione ,This is Devil's Snare. ,,,,,,,
Hermione ,You have to relax. ,,,,,,,
Hermione ,If you don't,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Kill us faster?! ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Oh,,,,,,,
Ron and Harry,  Hermione!!,,,,,,,
Ron,Now what are we gonna do?!,,,,,,,
Hermione,Just relax!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Hermione! Where are you?!,,,,,,,
Hermione,Do what I say. Trust me. ,,,,,,,
Ron ,Ahh! Harry!,,,,,,,
Ron,Harry!,,,,,,,
Hermione,Are you okay?,,,,,,,
Harry ,Yeah, I'm fine.,,,,,,
Ron ,Help!,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,He's not relaxing,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Apparently not.,,,,,,,
Ron ,Help! Help me!,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,We've got to do something!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,What?,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Help!,,,,,,,
Hermione,Um Devil's Snare,it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! ,,,,,,
Hermione,That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!,,,,,,,
Hermione,Lumus Solem!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Ahhh!,,,,,,,
Harry ,Ron,,,,,,,
Ron,Yeah.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Okay.,,,,,,,
Ron,Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,What is that?,,,,,,,
Harry,I don't know. ,,,,,,,
Harry,Sounds like wings.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Curious. I've never seen birds like these.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,They're not birds,,,,,,,
Harry  ,And I'll bet one of them fits that door. ,,,,,,,
Hermione ,What's this all about?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I don't know. Strange.,,,,,,,
Ron   ,Alohomora! ,,,,,,,
Ron   ,Well,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Ugh! What're we going to do? ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,There must be 1000 keys up there!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,We're looking for a big old fashioned one. ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Probably rusty like the handle.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,There! I see it!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,The one with the broken wing!,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,What's wrong,,,,,,,
Harry  ,It's too simple.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Oh, Harry! ,,,,,,
Ron  ,If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick,,,,,,,
Ron  ,You're the youngest seeker in a century!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,This complicates things a bit!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Catch the key!,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Hurry up!,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,I don't like this. ,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,I don't like this at all.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Where are we? A graveyard.,,,,,,,
Ron ,This is no graveyard. ,,,,,,,
Ron ,It's a chessboard.,,,,,,,
Harry ,There's the door.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,Now what do we do?,,,,,,,
Ron , It's obvious,,,,,,,
Ron ,We've got to play our way across the room. ,,,,,,,
Ron ,All right. Harry,,,,,,,
Ron ,Hermione,,,,,,,
Ron ,As for me,,,,,,,
Hermione ,What happens now?,,,,,,,
Ron,Well, and then...we play. ,,,,,,
Hermione ,Ron, do you?,,,,,,
Ron  ,You there! D-5! ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Yes, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!,,,,,,
Ron  ,Castle to E-4!  ,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Pawn to C-3!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Wait a minute.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,You understand right,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Once I make my move,,,,,,,
Harry  ,No,,,,,,,
Hermione , What is it?,,,,,,,
Harry  ,He's going to sacrifice himself!,,,,,,,
Hermione ,No, you can't!,,,,,,
Hermione ,There must be another way!,,,,,,,
Ron,Do you want to stop Snape from getting that Stone or not?,,,,,,,
Ron,Harry,,,,,,,
Ron,Not me, you. ,,,,,,
Ron,Knight...to H-3.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Check.,,,,,,,
Ron  ,Ahhhh!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,RON! ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,NO! Don't move! Dont forget,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Checkmate. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Take care of Ron. Then,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Send a message to Dumbledore. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Ron's right...I have to go on.,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,You'll be okay,,,,,,,
Hermione  ,You're a great wizard,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Not as good as you.,,,,,,,
Hermione,Me? Books and cleverness? ,,,,,,,
Hermione,There are more important things. ,,,,,,,
Hermione,Friendship,,,,,,,
Hermione,And Harry,,,,,,,
Harry ,You? No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one,,,,,,,
Quirrell ,Yes. He does seem the type,,,,,,,
Quirrell ,Next to him," """"p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?""""""",,,,,,
Harry  ,B-but, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.,,,,,
Quirrell  ,No,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,And trust me, I would have succeeded. ,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Snape was trying to...save me?,,,,,,,
Quirrell ,I knew you were a danger right from the off. ,,,,,,,
Quirrell ,Especially after Halloween.,,,,,,,
Harry ,Th-then you let the troll in.,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,Very good Potter,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,Snape, wasn't fooled. ,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,While everyone else was running to the dungeon,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,He, never trusted me again.,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,He rarely left me alone. ,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,But he doesn't understand. ,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,I'm never alone. Never. ,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,Now...what does this mirror do? ,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,I see what I desire. ,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,I see myself holding the stone. ,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,But how do I get it?,,,,,,,
Voldemort ,Use the boy,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,Come here, now!,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,Tell me. What do you see?,,,,,,,
Quirrell ,What is it?! What do you see?!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. ,,,,,,,
Harry  ,I've won the house cup.,,,,,,,
Voldemort,He lies.,,,,,,,
Quirrell,Tell the truth! What do you see?!,,,,,,,
Voldemort,Let me speak to him.,,,,,,,
Quirrell  ,Master,,,,,,,
Voldemort,I have strength enough for this. ,,,,,,,
Voldemort,Harry Potter. We meet again.,,,,,,,
Harry ,Voldemort.,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,Yes. You see what I have become? ,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,See what I must do to survive? ,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,Live off another. A mere parasite. ,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,Unicorn blood can sustain me,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,But there is something that can. ,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,Something, lies in your pocket!,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,Stop him! ,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,Don't be a fool! ,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Never!,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. ,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,Tell me, would you like to see your mother and father again? ,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,Together,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,All I ask for is something in return. ,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,That's it,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,There is no good and evil. ,,,,,,,
Voldemort  ,There is only power,,,,,,,

Voldemort  ,Arrrhhhhhh!,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Ahhhhhhhhh!,,,,,,,
Dumbledore ,Good afternoon,,,,,,,
Dumbledore ,Ah. Tokens from your admirers?,,,,,,,
Harry ,Admirers?,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, naturally, the whole school knows. ,,,,,
Dumbledore,Ah,,,,,,,
Harry ,Ron was here? ,,,,,,,
Harry ,Is he all right? ,,,,,,,
Harry ,What about Hermione?,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,Fine. They're both just fine.,,,,,,,
Harry ,But,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,Relax,,,,,,,
Dumbledore  ,My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.,,,,,,,
Harry,But Flamel, won't he?,,,,,,
Dumbledore,He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. ,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,But yes,,,,,,,
Harry  ,How is it I got the Stone,,,,,,,
Harry  ,One minute I was staring in the mirror,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,Ah. You see, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. ,,,,
Dumbledore,That is one of my more brilliant ideas. ,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,And between you and me thats saying something.,,,,,,,
Harry  ,Does that mean, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?,,,,,
Dumbledore ,Ah,,,,,,,
Dumbledore ,Harry,,,,,,,
Dumbledore ,It was because of your mother. ,,,,,,,
Dumbledore ,She sacrificed herself for you,,,,,,,
Dumbledore ,No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.,,,,,,
Dumbledore ,It lives in your very skin.,,,,,,,
Harry ,What is it?,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,Love, love. ,,,,,,
Dumbledore,Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. ,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,Mm. Alas. Earwax.,,,,,,,
Harry,All right there,,,,,,,
Ron,All right? You?,,,,,,,
Harry,All right. Hermione?,,,,,,,
Hermione,Never better.,,,,,,,

Dumbledore ,However,,,,,,,
Dumbledore ,And I have a few last minute points to award. ,,,,,,,
Dumbledore ,To Miss Hermione Granger, 50 points. ,,,,,,
Harry,Good job.,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,Second, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. ,,,,,,
Dumbledore,And third, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. ,,,,,
Hermione,We're tied with Slytherin!,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,And finally, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. ,,,,,,
Dumbledore,I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,Assuming that my calculations are correct,,,,,,,
Dumbledore,Gryffindor wins the House Cup!,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Yes!,,,,,,,
Seamus,Yeah! We won!!,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Come on now,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Train's leaving. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.,,,,,,,
Hermione,Come on,,,,,,,
Harry,One minute. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye,,,,,,,
Hagrid,This is for you.,,,,,,,
Harry,Thanks,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Oh. Go on...on with you. ,,,,,,,
Hagrid,Oh, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.
Harry,But Hagrid,,,,,,,
Hagrid,I do. But your cousin don't,,,,,,,
Hermione,Feels strange to be going home,,,,,,,
Harry,I'm not going home. Not really.,,,,,,,
