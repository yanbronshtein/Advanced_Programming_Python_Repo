FUDGE,As Minister for Magic, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.,,,,
FUDGE,The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.,,,,,,
FUDGE,She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.,,,,,,
FUDGE,She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.,,,,,,
FUDGE,So that's that and no harm done.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Pea soup?,,,,,,
HARRY,No,,,,,,
FUDGE,Yes?,,,,,,
HARRY,I don't understand.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Understand?,,,,,,
HARRY,I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Come now Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.,,,,,,
FUDGE,On the other hand, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.,,,,
HARRY,The state of things,,,,,,
FUDGE,We have a killer on the loose.,,,,,,
HARRY,Sirius Black,,,,,,
HARRY,But what's he got to do with me?,,,,,,
FUDGE,Nothing,,,,,,
FUDGE,And that's what matters.,,,,,,
FUDGE,And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.,,,,,,
FUDGE,These are your new schoolbooks.,,,,,,
FUDGE,I took the liberty of having them brought here.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Now Tom will show you to your room.,,,,,,
HARRY,Hedwig.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Oh, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.,,,,
VENDOR,Right! You gonna move that bus or what?,,,,,,
HOUSEKEEPER,Housekeeping! I'll come back later.,,,,,,
RON,I'm warning you,,,,,,
RON,Keep that beast away from Scabbers,,,,,,
HERMIONE,It's a cat,,,,,,
HERMIONE,What do you expect?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,It's in his nature.,,,,,,
RON,A cat? Is that what they told you?,,,,,,
RON,Looks like a pig with hair.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Crookshanks,,,,,,
RON,Harry.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry.,,,,,,
HARRY,Egypt. What's it like?,,,,,,
RON,Brilliant. Loads of old stuff like mummies, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.,,,,,

RON,Along with the dung beetle.,,,,,,
GEORGE,Not flashing that clipping again?,,,,,,
RON,I haven't shown anyone.,,,,,,
GEORGE,No,,,,,,
FRED,Not unless you count Tom.,,,,,,

HERMIONE,Good morning,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,Looking forward to a new term?,,,,,,
HARRY,Yeah. It should be great.,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,Harry,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,But I think that you need to know the facts.,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,You are in danger.,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,Grave danger.,,,,,,
HARRY,Has this anything to do with Sirius Black,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,What do you know about Sirius Black,,,,,,
HARRY,Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,Do you know why?,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,Thirteen years ago,,,,,,
HARRY,Voldemort.,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,Don't say his name.,,,,,,
HARRY,Sorry.,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,But to this day,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,To find you.,,,,,,
HARRY,And kill me.,,,,,,
MR. WEASLEY,Harry,,,,,,
HARRY,Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?,,,,,,
MRS. WEASLEY,Quick. Quick.,,,,,,
MRS. WEASLEY,Ron,,,,,,
MRS. WEASLEY,Oh,,,,,,
MRS. WEASLEY,Don't lose him!,,,,,,
HARRY,I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...I lost control.,,,,,,
RON,Brilliant.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Honestly, it's not funny.,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry was lucky not to be expelled.,,,,,,
HARRY,I was lucky not to be arrested actually.,,,,,,
RON,I still think it was brilliant.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Come on. Everywhere else is full,,,,,,
RON,Who do you think that is?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Professor R.J. Lupin.,,,,,,
RON,Do you know everything?,,,,,,
RON,How is it she knows everything?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,It's on his suitcase,,,,,,
RON,Oh.,,,,,,
HARRY,Do you think he's really asleep?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Seems to be. Why?,,,,,,
HARRY,I gotta tell you something.,,,,,,
RON,Let me get this straight.,,,,,,
RON,Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?,,,,,,
HARRY,Yeah.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,But they'll catch Black,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I mean,,,,,,
RON,Sure.,,,,,,
RON,Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous,,,,,,
HARRY,Thanks,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Why are we stopping?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,We can't be there yet.,,,,,,
RON,What's going on?,,,,,,
HARRY,I don't know.,,,,,,
HARRY,Maybe we've broken down.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Ouch,,,,,,
RON,There's something moving out there.,,,,,,
RON,I think someone's coming aboard.,,,,,,
RON,Bloody hell! What's happening?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry,,,,,,
HARRY,Thank you.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Here,,,,,,
LUPIN,It's all right. It's chocolate.,,,,,,
HARRY,What was that thing that came?,,,,,,
LUPIN,It was a dementor. ,,,,,,
LUPIN,One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now.,,,,,,
LUPIN,It was searching the train for Sirius Black.,,,,,,
LUPIN,If you'll excuse me,,,,,,
LUPIN,Eat. You'll feel better.,,,,,,
HARRY,What happened to me?,,,,,,
RON,Well,,,,,,
RON,We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.,,,,,,
HARRY,And did either of you two you know pass out?,,,,,,
RON,No.,,,,,,
RON,I felt weird,,,,,,
RON,Like I'd never be cheerful again.,,,,,,
HARRY,But someone was screaming.,,,,,,
HARRY,A woman.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,No one was screaming,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Now,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,First,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Good luck,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate,,,,,,
DRACO,Potter. Is it true you fainted?,,,,,,
DRACO,I mean,,,,,,
RON,Shove off,,,,,,
HARRY,How did he find out?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Just forget it.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Fortunately,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Finally,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Hogwarts will, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Dementors are vicious creatures.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Therefore,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,But you know,,,,,,
SEAMUS,Fortuna Major.,,,,,,
SEAMUS,Here,,,,,,
SEAMUS,She just won't let me in.,,,,,,
HARRY,Fortuna Major.,,,,,,
FAT LADY,No, wait.,,,,,
FAT LADY,Watch this.,,,,,,
FAT LADY,Amazing. Just with my voice.,,,,,,
HARRY,Fortuna Major.,,,,,,
FAT LADY,Yes,,,,,,
HARRY,Thank you.,,,,,,
HARRY,Still doing that after three years.,,,,,,
HARRY,She can't even sing.,,,,,,
SEAMUS,Exactly.,,,,,,
HARRY,Hey,,,,,,
SEAMUS,Hey,,,,,,
DEAN,Oh,,,,,,
HERMIONE,That's awful.,,,,,,
RON,Green. That's a monkey.,,,,,,
RON,What is that?,,,,,,
DEAN,You call that a monkey?,,,,,,
RON,Do not give him one again.,,,,,,
RON,Hey, try an elephant.,,,,,
SEAMUS,Ron,,,,,,
RON,I will.,,,,,,
SEAMUS,I think we have a winner.,,,,,,
RON,Oh,,,,,,
SEAMUS,Oh,,,,,,
RON,Look at him. His face.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Welcome,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,In this room,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,In this room,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,This term, the art of reading tea leaves.,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,So please,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,What do you see?,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,But first,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,First,,,,,,
HERMIONE,What a load of rubbish.,,,,,,
RON,Where did you come from?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Me?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I've been here all this time.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,You,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Is your grandmother quite well?,,,,,,
NEVILLE,I think so.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,I wouldn't be so sure of that.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Give me the cup.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Pity.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Broaden your minds.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Your aura is pulsing,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Are you in the beyond?,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,I think you are.,,,,,,
RON,Sure.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Look at the cup.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Tell me what you see.,,,,,,
RON,Yeah.,,,,,,
RON,Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.,,,,,,
RON,That's trials and suffering.,,,,,,
RON,And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.,,,,,,
RON,So you're gonna suffer,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Give me the cup.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Oh,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,My dear you have the Grim.,,,,,,
SEAMUS,The Grin? What's the Grin?,,,,,,
BEM,Not the Grin,,,,,,
BEM,Taking form of a giant spectral dog.,,,,,,
BEM,It's among the darkest omens in our world.,,,,,,
BEM,"It's an omen of death.""",,,,,,
RON,You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Oh, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.,,,,
HERMIONE,Now, that's a fascinating subject.,,,,,
RON,Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,A fair few.,,,,,,
RON,Hang on. That's not possible.,,,,,,
RON,Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.,,,,,,
RON,You have to be in two classes at once.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future.,,,,,,
HAGRID,That's it. Come on,,,,,,
HAGRID,Less talking,,,,,,
HAGRID,I got a real treat for you today.,,,,,,
HAGRID,A great lesson. So follow me.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Right,,,,,,
HAGRID,Form a group over there.,,,,,,
HAGRID,And open your books to page 49.,,,,,,
DRACO,Exactly how do we do that?,,,,,,
HAGRID,Just stroke the spine,,,,,,
HAGRID,Goodness me.,,,,,,
DRACO,Don't be such a wimp,,,,,,
NEVILLE,I'm okay. Okay.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I think they're funny.,,,,,,
DRACO,Oh,,,,,,
DRACO,Witty. God,,,,,,
DRACO,Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.,,,,,,
HARRY,Shut up,,,,,,
DRACO,Dementor! Dementor!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Just ignore him.,,,,,,
RON,You're supposed to stroke it.,,,,,,
NEVILLE,Yeah.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Tah- tah- tah- dah! Isn't he beautiful?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Say hello to Buckbeak.,,,,,,
RON,Hagrid,,,,,,
HAGRID,That, is a hippogriff.,,,,,
HAGRID,First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Very easily offended.,,,,,,
HAGRID,You do not want to insult a hippogriff.,,,,,,
HAGRID,It may be the last thing you ever do.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Now,,,,,,
HAGRID,Well done,,,,,,
HAGRID,Come on now.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Now you have to let him make the first move. ,,,,,,
HAGRID,It's only polite. So step up. Give him a nice bow.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Then you wait and see if he bows back.,,,,,,
HAGRID,If he does,,,,,,
HAGRID,If not... Well,,,,,,
HAGRID,Just make your bow.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Nice and low.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Back off,,,,,,
HAGRID,Keep still. Keep still.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Well done,,,,,,
HAGRID,Here, you.,,,,,
HAGRID,Right. I think you can go and pat him now.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Go on. Don't be shy.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Nice and slow,,,,,,
HAGRID,Nice and slow. Slow.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Not so fast,,,,,,
HAGRID,Slow down,,,,,,
HAGRID,Nice and slow.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Now let him come to you.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Slowly, slowly, slowly...,,,,
HAGRID,That's it…Yes!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Well done! Well done,,,,,,
HAGRID,well done!,,,,,,
BEM,Does he get to fly?,,,,,,
HAGRID,I think he may let you ride him now.,,,,,,
HARRY,What?,,,,,,
HAGRID,Come on.,,,,,,
HARRY,Hey, hey!,,,,,
HAGRID,Put you over here,,,,,,
HAGRID,Don't pull out any of his feathers,,,,,,
HAGRID,Well done, and well done, Buckbeak.,,,,
HERMIONE,That was wicked,,,,,,
DRACO,Oh,,,,,,
HAGRID,Well done,,,,,,
HAGRID,How am I doing me first day?,,,,,,
HARRY,Brilliant,,,,,,
DRACO,You're not dangerous at all, you great ugly brute!,,,,,
HAGRID,Malfoy,,,,,,
HAGRID,No!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Buckbeak!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Whoa, whoa...,,,,,
HAGRID,Whoa! Buckbeak!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Away,,,,,,
DRACO,It's killed me!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Calm down. It's just a scratch!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.,,,,,,
HAGRID,I'm the teacher. I'll do it.,,,,,,
DRACO,You're gonna regret this.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Class dismissed!,,,,,,
DRACO,You and your bloody chicken!,,,,,,
PANSY PARKINSON,Does it hurt terribly,,,,,,
DRACO,It comes and it goes.,,,,,,
DRACO,Still,,,,,,
DRACO,Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.,,,,,,
DRACO,I can't do homework for weeks.,,,,,,
RON,Listen to the idiot.,,,,,,
RON,He's really laying it on thick,,,,,,
HARRY,At least Hagrid didn't get fired.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I hear Draco's father's furious.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,We haven't heard the end of this.,,,,,,
SEAMUS,He's been sighted!,,,,,,
RON,Who?,,,,,,
SEAMUS,Sirius Black!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Dufftown? That's not far from here.,,,,,,
NEVILLE,You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts,,,,,,
BOY,With dementors at every entrance?,,,,,,
SEAMUS,Dementors?,,,,,,
SEAMUS,He slipped past them once.,,,,,,
SEAMUS,Who's to say he won't do it again?,,,,,,
BEM,That's right. Black could be anywhere.,,,,,,
BEM,It's like trying to catch smoke.,,,,,,
BEM,Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Intriguing,,,,,,
LUPIN,Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?,,,,,,
DEAN,That's a boggart,,,,,,
LUPIN,Very good,,,,,,
LUPIN,Now,,,,,,
HERMIONE,No one knows.,,,,,,
RON,When did she get here?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Boggarts are shape-shifters.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,That's what makes them so...,,,,,,
LUPIN,So terrifying, yes, yes...,,,,
LUPIN,Luckily,,,,,,
LUPIN,Let's practice it now.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Without wands,,,,,,
LUPIN,After me. Riddikulus!,,,,,,
CLASS,Riddikulus!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Very good.,,,,,,
LUPIN,A little louder and very clear.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Listen: Riddikulus!,,,,,,
CLASS,Riddikulus!,,,,,,
DRACO,This class is ridiculous.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Very good.,,,,,,
LUPIN,So much for the easy part. ,,,,,,
LUPIN,You see,,,,,,
LUPIN,What really finishes a boggart is laughter.,,,,,,
LUPIN,You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. ,,,,,,
LUPIN,Let me explain. Neville, please?,,,,,
LUPIN,Come on,,,,,,
LUPIN,Come on.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Hello. Neville,,,,,,
NEVILLE,Professor Snape.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Sorry?,,,,,,
NEVILLE,Professor Snape.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Professor Snape. Yes,,,,,,
LUPIN,You live with your grandmother.,,,,,,
NEVILLE,Yes. I don't want it to turn into her,,,,,,
LUPIN,No it won't. I want you to picture her clothes.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Only her clothes, in your mind.,,,,,
NEVILLE,She carries a red handbag...,,,,,,
LUPIN,We don't need to hear.,,,,,,
LUPIN,As long as you see it,,,,,,
LUPIN,Now,,,,,,
LUPIN,Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Can you do that?,,,,,,
LUPIN,Yes. Wand at the ready.,,,,,,
LUPIN,One, three.,,,,,
LUPIN,Think, think.,,,,,
NEVILLE,Riddikulus!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Wonderful, wonderful!,,,,,
LUPIN,Incredible! Okay to the back,,,,,,
LUPIN,Everyone,,,,,,
LUPIN,Form a line!,,,,,,
LUPIN,I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Next! Ron!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Concentrate. Face your fear.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Be brave!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Wand at the ready,,,,,,
RON,Riddikulus!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Yes!,,,,,,
LUPIN,You see? Very good,,,,,,
LUPIN,Marvelous! Absolutely, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!,,,,,
LUPIN,Show us what you see.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Keep your nerve. Steady.,,,,,,
PARVATI,Riddikulus!,,,,,,
LUPIN,And next! Step up,,,,,,
LUPIN,Wonderful,,,,,,
LUPIN,Riddikulus!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Right. Sorry about that.,,,,,,
LUPIN,That's enough for today.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Collect your books from the back.,,,,,,
LUPIN,That's the end of the lesson.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Thank you! Sorry!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Sorry,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Remember,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,No permission form signed,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,That's the rule,,,,,,
FILCH,Those with permission,,,,,,
FILCH,Those without,,,,,,
HARRY,I thought if you signed it,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Since I am neither,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,I'm sorry,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,That's my final word.,,,,,,
HARRY,Forget about it,,,,,,
HARRY,Professor,,,,,,
LUPIN,You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart,,,,,,
LUPIN,I thought it'd be obvious.,,,,,,
LUPIN,I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.,,,,,,
HARRY,I did think of Voldemort at first.,,,,,,
HARRY,But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.,,,,,,
LUPIN,I'm very impressed.,,,,,,
LUPIN,That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.,,,,,,
LUPIN,This is very wise.,,,,,,
HARRY,Before I fainted I heard something.,,,,,,
HARRY,A woman screaming.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Our pain becomes their power.,,,,,,
HARRY,I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.,,,,,,
LUPIN,The very first time I saw you, I recognized you immediately.,,,,,
LUPIN,Not by your scar,,,,,,
LUPIN,They're your mother,,,,,,
LUPIN,Yes. Oh,,,,,,
LUPIN,Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.,,,,,,
LUPIN,She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, when that person could not see it in themselves.,,,,,
LUPIN,And your father, on the other hand he...,,,,,
LUPIN,He had a certain, talent for trouble.,,,,,
LUPIN,A talent, he passed on to you.,,,,,
LUPIN,You're more like them than you know,,,,,,
LUPIN,In time,,,,,,
RON,Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,,,,,,
RON,We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.,,,,,,
RON,You heard it's the most...,,,,,,
HARRY,Haunted building in Britain. I know.,,,,,,
HARRY,What's going on?,,,,,,
RON,Probably Neville forgot the password again.,,,,,,
NEVILLE,Hey.,,,,,,
RON,Oh,,,,,,
PERCY,Let me through,,,,,,
PERCY,Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!,,,,,,
PERCY,Get back,,,,,,
PERCY,No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.,,,,,,
GINNY,The Fat Lady! She's gone!,,,,,,
RON,Serves her right.,,,,,,
RON,She was a terrible singer.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,It's not funny,,,,,,
PERCY,Keep calm,,,,,,
PERCY,Back to your common room.,,,,,,
PERCY,Be quiet. Make way.,,,,,,
PERCY,The headmaster's here.,,,,,,
FILCH,Come on,,,,,,
PERCY,You heard. Move!,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.,,,,,,
FILCH,There's no need for ghosts,,,,,,
FILCH,The Fat Lady's there.,,,,,,
PERCY,Mind where you're going! Slow down!,,,,,,
PERCY,You listen! I'm Head Boy!,,,,,,
PERCY,Come back here!,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Keep moving!,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Dear lady,,,,,,
FAT LADY,Eyes like the devil, and a soul as dark as his name.,,,,,
FAT LADY,It's him,,,,,,
FAT LADY,The one they all talk about.,,,,,,
FAT LADY,He's here,,,,,,
FAT LADY,Sirius Black!,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Secure the castle,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,The rest of you,,,,,,
FILCH,I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. ,,,,,,
FILCH,There's nothing there.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Thank you.,,,,,,
TEACHER,The third floor's clear too,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Very good.,,,,,,
SNAPE,I've done the dungeons.,,,,,,
SNAPE,No sign of Black,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,I didn't really expect him to linger.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Remarkable feat,,,,,,
SNAPE,To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own completely undetected?,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Quite remarkable,,,,,,
SNAPE,Any theories on how he managed it?,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.,,,,,,
SNAPE,You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.,,,,,,
SNAPE,What about Potter?,,,,,,
SNAPE,Should he be warned?,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Perhaps. But for now,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,For in dreams,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Turn to page 394.,,,,,,
HARRY,Excuse me,,,,,,
HARRY,Where's Professor Lupin?,,,,,,
SNAPE,That's not really your concern, Potter?,,,,,
SNAPE,Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Turn to page 394.,,,,,,
RON,Werewolves?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Sir,,,,,,
HERMIONE,We're not meant to start that for weeks.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Quiet.,,,,,,
RON,When did she come in?,,,,,,
RON,Did you see her come in?,,,,,,
SNAPE,Now,,,,,,
SNAPE,No one?,,,,,,
SNAPE,How disappointing.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Please,,,,,,
HERMIONE,An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,A werewolf has no choice.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,He'd kill his best friend.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Furthermore,,,,,,
SNAPE,Thank you,,,,,,
SNAPE,That's the second time you've spoken out of turn,,,,,,
SNAPE,Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?,,,,,,
RON,He's got a point,,,,,,
SNAPE,Five points from Gryffindor.,,,,,,
SNAPE,As an antidote to your ignorance, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.,,,,
HARRY,It's Quidditch tomorrow.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Then I suggest you take extra care,,,,,,
SNAPE,Loss of limb will not excuse you.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Page 394.,,,,,,
SNAPE,"The term ""werewolf"" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word ""were"" which means ""man"," man-wolf.""",,,,,
SNAPE,There are several ways to become a werewolf.,,,,,,
SNAPE,They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...,,,,,,
CROWD,Go Go Gryffindor!!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Go, Harry!,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Aresto momentum!,,,,,,
RON,He looks a bit peaky,,,,,,
FRED,Peaky?,,,,,,
FRED,What do you expect?,,,,,,
FRED,He fell over 100 feet.,,,,,,
GEORGE,Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.,,,,,,
HARRY,Probably a right sight better than he normally does.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,How are you feeling?,,,,,,
HARRY,Oh,,,,,,
GEORGE,You gave us a right good scare.,,,,,,
HARRY,What happened?,,,,,,
RON,Well,,,,,,
HARRY,Really? I meant the match. Who won?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,No one blames you,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,After he saved you,,,,,,
RON,There's something else you should know too.,,,,,,
RON,When you fell, and...Well...,,,,,
LUPIN,I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Is there no chance of fixing it?,,,,,,
HARRY,No.,,,,,,
HARRY,Professor,,,,,,
HARRY,I mean,,,,,,
LUPIN,Listen.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.,,,,,,
LUPIN,They feed on every good feeling,,,,,,
LUPIN,You are not weak,,,,,,
LUPIN,Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.,,,,,,
LUPIN,You have nothing to be ashamed of.,,,,,,
HARRY,I'm scared,,,,,,
LUPIN,Well,,,,,,
HARRY,I need to know how to fight them.,,,,,,
HARRY,You could teach me.,,,,,,
HARRY,You made the one on the train go away.,,,,,,
LUPIN,There was only one that night.,,,,,,
HARRY,But you made it go away.,,,,,,
LUPIN,I don't pretend to be an expert,,,,,,
LUPIN,But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.,,,,,,
LUPIN,But after the holidays.,,,,,,
LUPIN,For now,,,,,,
MAN,Last call for Hogsmeade!,,,,,,
MAN,Come on,,,,,,
HARRY,Guys,,,,,,
FRED,Clever,,,,,,
GEORGE,But not clever enough.,,,,,,
FRED,We've got a better way.,,,,,,
HARRY,I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.,,,,,,
FRED & GEORGE,We know.,,,,,,
FRED,We'll get you there.,,,,,,
GEORGE,We'll show you a quicker way.,,,,,,
FRED,If you pipe down.,,,,,,
FRED,Bless him.,,,,,,
HARRY,Let me go! Come on,,,,,,
FRED,Now,,,,,,
GEORGE,Come and join the big boys.,,,,,,
HARRY,What are you doing?!,,,,,,
HARRY,What's this rubbish?,,,,,,
GEORGE,What's this rubbish? he says.,,,,,,
FRED,It's the secret to our success.,,,,,,
GEORGE,It's a wrench giving it to you...,,,,,,
FRED,But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.,,,,,,
FRED,George,,,,,,
GEORGE,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.,,,,,,
HARRY,Messrs. Moony, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map.,,,,,
GEORGE,We owe them so much.,,,,,,
HARRY,Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that…,,,,,,
HARRY,No. Is that really...?,,,,,,
FRED,Dumbledore.,,,,,,
GEORGE,In his study.,,,,,,
FRED,Pacing.,,,,,,
GEORGE,Does that a lot.,,,,,,
HARRY,So you mean this map shows...,,,,,,
FRED,Everyone.,,,,,,
HARRY,Everyone?,,,,,,
GEORGE,Where they are.,,,,,,
FRED,What they're doing.,,,,,,
GEORGE,Every minute.,,,,,,
FRED,Every day.,,,,,,
HARRY,Brilliant! Where did you get it?,,,,,,
FRED,From Filch's office.,,,,,,
FRED,First year.,,,,,,
GEORGE,There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.,,,,,,
GEORGE,We'd recommend this one.,,,,,,
FRED,The One-Eyed Witch passageway.,,,,,,
GEORGE,Leads straight you to Honeyduke's.,,,,,,
FRED,Hurry. Filch is heading this way.,,,,,,
GEORGE,Oh Harry and don't forget. When you're done,,,,,,
FRED & GEORGE,Mischief managed.,,,,,,
FRED & GEORGE,Otherwise,,,,,,
WITCH,Now,,,,,,
BOY,Delicious.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?,,,,,,
RON,Twice.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Do you want to move a bit closer?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,To the Shrieking Shack?,,,,,,
RON,Actually,,,,,,
DRACO,Well,,,,,,
DRACO,You two shopping for your new dream home?,,,,,,
DRACO,Bit grand for you, Weasle-Bee?,,,,,
DRACO,Don't your family sleep in one room?,,,,,,
RON,Shut your mouth,,,,,,
DRACO,Not very friendly.,,,,,,
DRACO,Boys,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Hope you don't mean yourself.,,,,,,
DRACO,How dare you talk to me!,,,,,,
DRACO,You filthy little mudblood!,,,,,,
DRACO,Who is that?,,,,,,
DRACO,Don't stand there! Do something!,,,,,,
CRABBE,What?,,,,,,
RON,What's up,,,,,,
DRACO,Get out of the way!,,,,,,
DRACO,Move!,,,,,,
CRABBE,Malfoy! Wait! Wait!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry!,,,,,,
RON,Bloody hell,,,,,,
RON,That was not funny.,,,,,,
RON,Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?,,,,,,
RON,Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Ron fancies her.,,,,,,
RON,That's not true!,,,,,,
FUDGE,Professor McGonagall!,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Cornelius!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Allow me,,,,,,
FUDGE,Oh,,,,,,
HAGRID,Sorry about that.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Rosmerta,,,,,,
FUDGE,I hope business is good.,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!,,,,,,
FUDGE,We have...We have a killer on the loose.,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,And what would bring him here?,,,,,,
FUDGE,Harry Potter.,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,Harry Potter?,,,,,,
FUDGE,Shh! Come.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry!,,,,,,
SHRUNKEN HEAD 1,No underage wizards allowed in today!,,,,,,
SHRUNKEN HEAD 2,Shut the damn door!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,So rude.,,,,,,
RON,Thick heads.,,,,,,
SHRUNKEN HEAD 1,Thick heads?!,,,,,,
SHRUNKEN HEAD 2,How dare they!,,,,,,
SHRUNKEN HEAD 2,Who are they calling thick heads?,,,,,,
SHRUNKEN HEAD 1,Young whippersnappers!,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,Tell me what this is all about.,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Years ago,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Remember? They hid.,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Few knew where they were.,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,One who did was Sirius Black.,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,And he told You-Know-Who.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed one of their friends Peter Pettigrew!,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,Peter Pettigrew?,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Little lump of a boy.,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Always trailing after Black.,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,I remember.,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,What happened?,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, Sirius Black.,,,,,
FUDGE,Black was vicious.,,,,,,
FUDGE,He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him!,,,,,,
FUDGE,A finger. That's all that was left.,,,,,,
FUDGE,A finger. Nothing else.,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Yes,,,,,,
FUDGE,And now he wants to finish what he started.,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,I don't believe it.,,,,,,
FUDGE,That's not the worst of it.,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,What could be worse?,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,This: Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Ron,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me,,,,,,
RON,Merry Christmas.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry,,,,,,
HARRY,He was their friend and he betrayed them.,,,,,,
HARRY,He was their friend!,,,,,,
HARRY,I hope he finds me.,,,,,,
HARRY,Because when he does,,,,,,
HARRY,When he does,,,,,,
LUPIN,Harry. There you are. You came.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Are you sure about this,,,,,,
LUPIN,This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.,,,,,,
HARRY,I'm sure.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Well,,,,,,
LUPIN,The spell I'm going to try yo teach you is called the Patronus Charm.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Did you ever hear of it?,,,,,,
LUPIN,No? Well...A Patronus is a positive force.,,,,,,
LUPIN,For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield,,,,,,
LUPIN,But in order for it to work,,,,,,
LUPIN,Not just any memory, a very powerful memory.,,,,,
LUPIN,Can you do this?,,,,,,
HARRY,Yes.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Very well. Close your eyes.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Concentrate.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Explore your past.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Do you have a memory?,,,,,,
LUPIN,Allow it to fill you up.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Lose yourself within it.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Then speak the incantation,,,,,,
HARRY,Expecto Patronum.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Very good.,,,,,,
HARRY,Shall we? Wand at the ready.,,,,,,
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!,,,,,,
HARRY,Expecto... Expecto...Expect...,,,,,,
LUPIN,Here we go. Come on.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Sit up. Deep breaths.,,,,,,
LUPIN,It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time.,,,,,,
LUPIN,That would have been remarkable.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Here,,,,,,
HARRY,That's one nasty dementor.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Oh, no, no.,,,,
LUPIN,That was a boggart,,,,,,
LUPIN,The real thing would be worse.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Much,,,,,,
LUPIN,As a matter of interest,,,,,,
LUPIN,Which memory did you choose?,,,,,,
HARRY,The first time I rode a broom.,,,,,,
LUPIN,That's not good enough.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Not nearly good enough.,,,,,,
HARRY,There's another.,,,,,,
HARRY,It's not happy,,,,,,
HARRY,Well,,,,,,
HARRY,It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Is it strong?,,,,,,
LUPIN,Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?,,,,,,
HARRY,Just do it.,,,,,,
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!,,,,,,
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Yes! Well done,,,,,,
HARRY,I think I've had enough for today.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Yes. Sit down. Here.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Eat this,,,,,,
LUPIN,And just so you know,,,,,,
LUPIN,And that is saying something.,,,,,,
HARRY,I was thinking of him. And Mum.,,,,,,
HARRY,Seeing their faces.,,,,,,
HARRY,They were talking to me.,,,,,,
HARRY,Just talking.,,,,,,
HARRY,That's the memory I chose.,,,,,,
HARRY,I don't even know if it's real.,,,,,,
HARRY,But it's the best I have.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Beautiful day.,,,,,,
RON,Gorgeous.,,,,,,
RON,Unless you've been ripped to pieces!,,,,,,
HARRY,Ripped to pieces?,,,,,,
HARRY,What are you talking about?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Ronald has lost his rat.,,,,,,
RON,I haven't lost anything!,,,,,,
RON,Your cat killed him!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Rubbish.,,,,,,
RON,Harry,,,,,,
RON,And Scabbers is gone.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Well,,,,,,
RON,Your cat killed him!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Did not.,,,,,,
RON,Did.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Didn't.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,How did it go,,,,,,
HAGRID,Well, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.,,,,,
HAGRID,I got up and did my piece.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff,,,,,,
HAGRID,And then Lucius Malfoy got up.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Well,,,,,,
HAGRID,He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,And then?,,,,,,
HAGRID,And then he asked for the worst,,,,,,
RON,They're not sacking you!,,,,,,
HAGRID,No,,,,,,
HAGRID,Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!,,,,,,
RON,Spiders! There's... There's spiders.,,,,,,
RON,Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.,,,,,,
RON,I don't wanna tap-dance!,,,,,,
HARRY,Tell those spiders.,,,,,,
RON,Right,,,,,,
MADAM ROSMERTA,Peter Pettigrew?,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Little lump of a boy.,,,,,,
MCGONAGALL,Always trailing after Sirius Black.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Black was vicious.,,,,,,
FUDGE,He didn 't kill Pettigrew,,,,,,
VOICE,Put that light out!,,,,,,
HARRY,Sorry.,,,,,,
VOICE,Watch it there,,,,,,
VOICE,We're trying to sleep here!,,,,,,
HARRY,Mischief managed. Nox.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Potter.,,,,,,
SNAPE,What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?,,,,,,
HARRY,I was sleepwalking.,,,,,,
SNAPE,How extraordinarily like your father you are,,,,,,
SNAPE,He, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.,,,,
HARRY,My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.,,,,,,
HARRY,If you don't mind,,,,,,
SNAPE,Turn out your pockets.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Turn out your pockets!,,,,,,
SNAPE,What's this?,,,,,,
HARRY,Spare bit of parchment.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Really? Open it.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Reveal your secrets.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Read it.,,,,,,
HARRY,Messrs. Moony, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...,,,,
SNAPE,Go on.,,,,,,
HARRY,And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business.,,,,,,
SNAPE,You insolent little...,,,,,,
LUPIN,Professor!,,,,,,
SNAPE,Well,,,,,,
SNAPE,Out for a little walk in the moonlight,,,,,,
LUPIN,Harry,,,,,,
SNAPE,That remains to be seen.,,,,,,
SNAPE,I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Take a look,,,,,,
SNAPE,Supposed to be your area of expertise.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Clearly,,,,,,
LUPIN,I seriously doubt it,,,,,,
LUPIN,It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.,,,,,,
LUPIN,I suspect it's a Zonko product.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Nevertheless,,,,,,
LUPIN,It is, as you say, my area of expertise.,,,,
LUPIN,Harry, please? Professor, good night.,,,,
VOICE,Are you deaf? Put that light out!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Come in.,,,,,,
LUPIN,I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly,,,,,,
LUPIN,Did it never occur to you that this,,,,,,
LUPIN,No.,,,,,,
HARRY,No,,,,,,
LUPIN,Your father never set much store by the rules either.,,,,,,
LUPIN,But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Now,,,,,,
LUPIN,Do you hear me?,,,,,,
HARRY,Yes,,,,,,
LUPIN,I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.,,,,,,
LUPIN,And don't take any detours.,,,,,,
LUPIN,If you do,,,,,,
HARRY,Professor, I don't think that map always works.,,,,,
HARRY,Earlier,,,,,,
HARRY,Someone I know to be dead.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Oh,,,,,,
HARRY,Peter Pettigrew.,,,,,,
LUPIN,That's not possible.,,,,,,
HARRY,It's just what I saw.,,,,,,
HARRY,Good night,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Broaden your minds.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,You must look beyond.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Only then can you see. Try again.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Now,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Do you mind me trying?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,The Grim,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,My dear,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,No, there.,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,You may be young in years, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Have I said something?,,,,,,
RON,She's gone mental,,,,,,
RON,I mean,,,,,,
HARRY,Hang on.,,,,,,
HARRY,We better take this back.,,,,,,
RON,I'm not going back.,,,,,,
HARRY,Fine. See you later.,,,,,,
RON,See you.,,,,,,
VOICE,Harry Potter,,,,,,
HARRY,Professor Trelawney...,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,He will return tonight.,,,,,,
HARRY,Sorry?,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Tonight, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,I'm so sorry,,,,,,
TRELAWNEY,Did you say something?,,,,,,
HARRY,No. Nothing.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.,,,,,,
RON,It just got worse.,,,,,,
DRACO,What did I say? Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.,,,,,,
DRACO,I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.,,,,,,
DRACO,This is going to be rich.,,,,,,
GOYLE,Look who's here.,,,,,,
DRACO,Come to see the show?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,You! You foul, evil little cockroach!,,,,,
RON,Hermione,,,,,,
RON,He's not worth it.,,,,,,
GOYLE,Malfoy,,,,,,
GOYLE,Let's go. Quick.,,,,,,
DRACO,Not a word to anyone,,,,,,
HERMIONE,That felt good.,,,,,,
RON,Not good,,,,,,
HAGRID,Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.,,,,,,
HARRY,Why don't we just set him free?,,,,,,
HAGRID,They'd know it was me,,,,,,
HAGRID,He's coming down,,,,,,
HAGRID,Says he wants to be with me when they...When it happens.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Great man,,,,,,
HAGRID,A great man.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,We'll stay with you too.,,,,,,
HAGRID,You'll do no such thing!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Think I want you seeing something like that? No.,,,,,,
HAGRID,You just drink your tea and be off.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Oh. Before you do,,,,,,
RON,Scabbers! You're alive!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Keep a closer eye on your pet.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I think you owe someone an apology.,,,,,,
RON,Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I meant me!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Blimey. What was that?,,,,,,
HARRY,Hagrid!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Oh,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,No,,,,,,
HAGRID,It's late. It's nearly dark.,,,,,,
HAGRID,You shouldn't be here.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Someone sees you outside this time of night,,,,,,
HAGRID,Particularly you,,,,,,
HAGRID,With you in a moment!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Quick. Quick!,,,,,,
HARRY,Hagrid.,,,,,,
HARRY,It'll be fine. It'll be okay.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Go on,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,That's ling you see over there...,,,,,,
FUDGE,On the slope.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,On the slope... Ah,,,,,,
HAGRID,Professor Dumbledore.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Good evening.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Minister. Make your way through.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Have a tea,,,,,,
FUDGE,No,,,,,,
HAGRID,Gentlemen.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,I'd like a cup of tea.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Well, shall we?,,,,,
FUDGE,"Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak here in after called ""the condemned",,,,,,
HAGRID,Dear,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Now, Hagrid. Now, come on.,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,All right. It'll be all right.,,,,,,
FUDGE,The execution shall dispatch...,,,,,,
HARRY,What?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I thought I just saw...Never mind.,,,,,,
RON,Let's go!,,,,,,
HAGRID,Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.,,,,,,
HARRY,Oh,,,,,,
RON,He bit me. Scabbers.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Ron. Ron!,,,,,,
HARRY,Ron!,,,,,,
RON,Scabbers,,,,,,
HARRY,Wait!,,,,,,
RON,Scabbers,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry,,,,,,
HARRY,That's not good. Ron,,,,,,
RON,Harry, run!,,,,,
RON,It's the Grim!,,,,,,
RON,Ah! Harry!,,,,,,
HARRY,Ron! Ron,,,,,,
RON,Harry!Help!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Ron!!,,,,,,
HARRY,Ron!,,,,,,
HARRY,Ron. Ron.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Ron!,,,,,,
HARRY,Come on!,,,,,,
HARRY,Move!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Duck!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Oh,,,,,,
HARRY,Don't worry.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Where do you suppose this goes?,,,,,,
HARRY,I have a hunch.,,,,,,
HARRY,I just hope I'm wrong.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,We're in the Shrieking Shack,,,,,,
HARRY,Come on.,,,,,,
HARRY,Ron.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Ron. You're okay.,,,,,,
HARRY,The dog. Where is it?,,,,,,
RON,It's a trap. He's the dog.,,,,,,
RON,He's an Animagus.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,If you want to kill Harry,,,,,,
SIRIUS,No. Only one will die tonight.,,,,,,
HARRY,Then it'll be you!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Are you going to kill me,,,,,,
LUPIN,Expelliarmus!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Well, Sirius.,,,,,
LUPIN,Looking rather ragged,,,,,,
LUPIN,Finally,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Well, wouldn't you Remus?,,,,,
SIRIUS,I found him.,,,,,,
LUPIN,I know.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,It's him.,,,,,,
LUPIN,I understand.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Let's kill him!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,No! I trusted you!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,And all this time,,,,,,
HERMIONE,He's a werewolf!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,That's why he's been missing classes.,,,,,,
LUPIN,How long have you known?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Since Professor Snape set the essay.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Well,,,,,,
LUPIN,You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Enough talk,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Come on,,,,,,
LUPIN,Wait!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,I did my waiting!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Twelve years of it! In Azkaban!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Very well. Kill him.,,,,,,
LUPIN,But wait one more minute.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Harry has the right to know why.,,,,,,
HARRY,I know why.,,,,,,
HARRY,You betrayed my parents.,,,,,,
HARRY,You're the reason they're dead!,,,,,,
LUPIN,No,,,,,,
LUPIN,Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, I believed to be dead!,,,,,
HARRY,Who was it,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Peter Pettigrew!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,And he's in this room! Right now!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Come out, Peter!,,,,,
SIRIUS,Come out,,,,,,
SNAPE,Expelliarmus!,,,,,,
SNAPE,Vengeance is sweet.,,,,,,
SNAPE,How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Severus...,,,,,,
SNAPE,I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Brilliant,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Once again you've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,If you'll excuse us,,,,,,
SNAPE,Give me a reason. I beg you!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Severus don't be a fool.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,He can't help it. It's habit.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Sirius be quiet.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Be quiet yourself!,,,,,,
SNAPE,You two,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!,,,,,,
SNAPE,I could do it,,,,,,
SNAPE,But why deny the dementors?,,,,,,
SNAPE,They're so longing to see you.,,,,,,
SNAPE,Do I detect a flicker of fear?,,,,,,
SNAPE,Oh,,,,,,
SNAPE,It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness,,,,,,
LUPIN,Severus,,,,,,
SNAPE,After you.,,,,,,
HARRY,Expelliarmus!,,,,,,
RON,Harry! What did you just do?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,You attacked a teacher!,,,,,,
HARRY,Tell me about Peter.,,,,,,
LUPIN,He was at school with us.,,,,,,
LUPIN,We thought he was our friend!,,,,,,
HARRY,No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!,,,,,,
LUPIN,No,,,,,,
LUPIN,I thought so too,,,,,,
HARRY,The map was lying,,,,,,
SIRIUS,The map never lies!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Pettigrew's alive!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,And he's right there!,,,,,,
RON,Me?! He's mental!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Not you! Your rat!,,,,,,
RON,Scabbers has been in my family for...,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Twelve years?,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Curiously long life for a common garden rat!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,He's missing a toe,,,,,,
RON,So what?,,,,,,
HARRY,All they could find of Pettigrew was his...,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Finger!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,And then he transformed into a rat!,,,,,,
HARRY,Show me.,,,,,,
HARRY,Give it to him,,,,,,
RON,What are you trying to do to him?,,,,,,
RON,Scabbers!,,,,,,
RON,Leave him alone! Get off him!,,,,,,
RON,What are you doing?,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,Remus? Sirius. My old friends!,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,Harry! Look at you.,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,You look so much like your father.,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,James. We were the best of friends...,,,,,,
SIRIUS,How dare you speak to Harry!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,How dare you talk about James in front of him!,,,,,,
LUPIN,You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,I didn't mean to!,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses!,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,Ask yourself,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,What would you have done?,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,What would you have done?,,,,,,
SIRIUS,I'm gonna died,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,James wouldn't have wanted me killed!,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,Your dad would have spared me!,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,He would have shown me mercy!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you,,,,,,
HARRY,No!,,,,,,
LUPIN,Harry,,,,,,
HARRY,I know what he is.,,,,,,
HARRY,But we'll take him to the castle.,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,Bless you,,,,,,
HARRY,Get off!,,,,,,
HARRY,I said we'd take you to the castle.,,,,,,
HARRY,After that,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Sorry about the bite.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,I reckon that twinges a bit.,,,,,,
RON,A bit? A bit?,,,,,,
RON,You almost tore my leg off!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,I was going for the rat.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Normally,,,,,,
SIRIUS,More than once,,,,,,
SIRIUS,The tail I could live with.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,But the fleas,,,,,,
HARRY,Okay.,,,,,,
RON,You better go.,,,,,,
HARRY,No. Don't worry,,,,,,
HARRY,It's fine. I'll stay.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,You go,,,,,,
HARRY,You okay?,,,,,,
RON,I'm fine. Go.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,That looks really painful.,,,,,,
RON,So painful.,,,,,,
RON,They might chop it.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.,,,,,,
RON,It's too late. It's ruined.,,,,,,
RON,It'll have to be chopped off.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,It's beautiful,,,,,,
SIRIUS,I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,That was a noble thing you did back there.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,He doesn't deserve it.,,,,,,
HARRY,I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.,,,,,,
HARRY,Besides, the truth dies with him.,,,,,
HARRY,Alive,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,Turn me into a flobberworm.,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,Anything but the dementors!,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,You won't let them give me to the dementors,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,I was your rat!,,,,,,
PETTIGREW,Sweet,,,,,,
LUPIN,Get away from her!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,I don't know if you know, James and Lily made me your godfather.,,,,,
HARRY,I know.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...,,,,,,
HARRY,What? Come and live with you?,,,,,,
SIRIUS,It's just a thought.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,I can understand if you don't want to.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Remus,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Have you taken your potion tonight?,,,,,,
SIRIUS,You know the man you truly are,,,,,,
SIRIUS,This heart is where you truly live! Here!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,This flesh is only flesh!,,,,,,
HARRY,Expelliarmus!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Remus! Remus!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Run! Run!,,,,,,
HARRY,Come on.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Wait. Wait.,,,,,,
RON,Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Professor? Professor Lupin?,,,,,,
RON,Nice doggy. Nice doggy!,,,,,,
SNAPE,There you are,,,,,,
HARRY,Sirius!,,,,,,
SNAPE,Come back here,,,,,,
HARRY,Sirius!,,,,,,
HARRY,No. Sirius!,,,,,,
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry?,,,,,,
HARRY,I saw my dad.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,What?,,,,,,
HARRY,He sent the dementors away.,,,,,,
HARRY,I saw him across the lake.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Listen Harry,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.,,,,,,
HARRY,They're gonna kill him?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,No. It's worse.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Much worse.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,They're going to suck out his soul.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Headmaster,,,,,,
HERMIONE,They've got the wrong man.,,,,,,
HARRY,It's true sir. Sirius is innocent.,,,,,,
RON,It's Scabbers who did it.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Scabbers?,,,,,,
RON,He's my rat,,,,,,
RON,He's not really a rat. He was a rat.,,,,,,
RON,He was my brother Percy's rat.,,,,,,
RON,But then they gave him an owl...,,,,,,
HERMIONE,The point is,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Please believe us.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,I do,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,A child's voice,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Mysterious thing,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Powerful and when meddled with,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,You know the laws,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,You must not be seen.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,And you would do well, to return before this last chime.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,If not,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Three turns should do it,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Oh,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,When in doubt,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Good luck.,,,,,,
RON,What the bloody hell was that all about?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Sorry, but seeing as you can't walk...,,,,,
HARRY,What just happened?,,,,,,
HARRY,Where's Ron?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,07:30. Where were we at 7:30?,,,,,,
HARRY,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Come on. And we can't be seen.,,,,,,
HARRY,Hermione!,,,,,,
HARRY,Hermione! Hermione,,,,,,
HARRY,Hermione,,,,,,
DRACO,Come to see the show?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,You! You foul,evil little cockroach!,,,,,
HARRY,That's us.,,,,,,
RON,Hermione,,,,,,
HARRY,This is not normal.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,This is a Time-Turner,,,,,,
HERMIONE,McGonagall gave it to me first term.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.,,,,,,
HARRY,You mean we've gone back in time?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Yes.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Clearly,,,,,,
HARRY,Good punch.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Thanks.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Malfoy's coming.,,,,,,
GOYLE,Run.,,,,,,
DRACO,Not a word to anyone,,,,,,
DRACO,I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,That felt good.,,,,,,
RON,Not good,,,,,,
HARRY,Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.,,,,,,
HARRY,Look. Buckbeak's still alive.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Of course.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Remember what Dumbledore said?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,If we succeed,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Let's go.,,,,,,
HARRY,Here they come. I'd better hurry.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Otherwise,,,,,,
RON,Scabbers,,,,,,
HAGRID,Keep a closer eye on your pet.,,,,,,
HARRY,That's Pettigrew.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry,,,,,,
HARRY,Hermione that's the he betrayed my parents.,,,,,,
HARRY,You don't expect me to sit here.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Yes,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry,,,,,,
HERMIONE,If you go bursting in,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time Harry.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,We can't be seen.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Fudge is coming.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,And we aren't leaving?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Why aren't we leaving?,,,,,,
HARRY,Are you mad?,,,,,,
HARRY,That hurt.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Sorry.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,We're coming out the back door. Go!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?,,,,,,
HARRY,What?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I thought I just saw… Never mind.,,,,,,
RON,Let's go.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Okay, Harry. Go!,,,,,
HARRY,Get away. Get off.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Minister,,,,,,
FUDGE,Yes,,,,,,
HARRY,Okay,,,,,,
HARRY,Come with us now. Come on.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.,,,,,,
HARRY,Buckbeak. Okay?,,,,,,
HARRY,Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?,,,,,,
FUDGE,Your name only.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,It's such a very long name...,,,,,,
HARRY,Hurry up now, okay?,,,,,
HERMIONE,Come on. Come on,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Come and get the nice dead ferret.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Come on. It's here. Come on,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Here we are,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Now,,,,,,
FUDGE,Where?,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Look beyond the rocks.,,,,,,
FUDGE,What am I supposed to see?,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Oh, indeed.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,And all the strawberries.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Come on,,,,,,
FUDGE,I see no strawberries.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Over there.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Where?,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Over there.,,,,,,
HARRY,This way.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Let's get this over,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,All right.,,,,,,
FUDGE,But where is it?,,,,,,
FUDGE,I saw the beast,,,,,,
FUDGE,Not a moment ago!,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,How extraordinary.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Buckbeak.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Come now,,,,,,
FUDGE,Someone's obviously released him.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Hagrid?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Buckbeak.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Afterall,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,You've been with us all the time.,,,,,,
HAGRID,Right.,,,,,,
FUDGE,Well,,,,,,
FUDGE,We must search the grounds.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Well, if you must, minister.,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Meanwhile,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Oh, your services are no longer required.,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Thank you.,,,,,,
HAGRID,You'll find no small glasses in this house,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Come on.,,,,,,
HARRY,This way.,,,,,,
HARRY,This way,,,,,,
HARRY,Now what?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,We save Sirius.,,,,,,
HARRY,How?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,No idea.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Look. It's Lupin.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Immobulus!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,And Snape's coming.,,,,,,
HARRY,And now we wait.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,And now we wait.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,At least someone's enjoying himself.,,,,,,
HARRY,Yeah.,,,,,,
HARRY,Hermione?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Yeah?,,,,,,
HARRY,Before, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.,,,,,
HARRY,That someone made the dementors go away.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,With a Patronus.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.,,,,,,
HARRY,It was my dad.,,,,,,
HARRY,It was my dad conjured the Patronus.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry,,,,,,
HARRY,Dead. I know.,,,,,,
HARRY,I'm just telling you what I saw.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Here we come.,,,,,,
HARRY,You see Sirius talking to me there?,,,,,,
HARRY,He's asking me to come live with him.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,That's great.,,,,,,
HARRY,When we free him,,,,,,
HARRY,It'll just be me and him.,,,,,,
HARRY,We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.,,,,,,
HARRY,He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Run! Run!,,,,,,
HARRY,Let's go.,,,,,,
HARRY,What are you doing?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Saving your life.,,,,,,
HARRY,Thanks.,,,,,,
HARRY,Great. Now he's coming for us.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Yeah,,,,,,
HERMIONE,That was so scary.,,,,,,
HARRY,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.,,,,,,
HARRY,Sirius. Come on!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,This is horrible.,,,,,,
HARRY,Don't worry.,,,,,,
HARRY,My dad will come.,,,,,,
HARRY,He'll conjure the Patronus.,,,,,,
HARRY,Any minute now.,,,,,,
HARRY,Right there. You'll see.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry,,,,,,
HERMIONE,No one's coming.,,,,,,
HARRY,Don't worry,,,,,,
HARRY,He will come.,,,,,,
HARRY,Sirius.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,You're dying both of you.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Harry!,,,,,,
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!,,,,,,
HARRY,You were right,,,,,,
HARRY,It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me!,,,,,,
HARRY,I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.,,,,,,
HARRY,I knew I could do it this time because well,,,,,,
HARRY,Does that make sense?,,,,,,
HERMIONE,No. But I don't like flying...!,,,,,,
HERMIONE,Bombarda!,,,,,,
SIRIUS,I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.,,,,,,
HARRY,I want to go with you.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,One day,,,,,,
SIRIUS,For some time,,,,,,
SIRIUS,And besides you're meant to be here.,,,,,,
HARRY,But you're innocent.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,And you know it.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,And for now,,,,,,
SIRIUS,I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,Except your eyes. You have...,,,,,,
HARRY,My mother's eyes.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily,,,,,,
SIRIUS,But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,And you can always find them in here.,,,,,,
SIRIUS,You really are the brightest witch of your age.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,We have to go.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Well?,,,,,,
HARRY,He's free. We did it.,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Did what?,,,,,,
DUMBLEDORE,Good night.,,,,,,
RON,How did you get there?,,,,,,
RON,I was talking to you there.,,,,,,
RON,And now you're there.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,What's he talking about,,,,,,
HARRY,I don't know.,,,,,,
HARRY,Honestly,,,,,,
LUPIN,Hello,,,,,,
LUPIN,I saw you coming.,,,,,,
LUPIN,I've looked worse,,,,,,
HARRY,You've been sacked.,,,,,,
LUPIN,No. No. I resigned,,,,,,
HARRY,Resigned? Why?,,,,,,
LUPIN,Well,,,,,,
LUPIN,This time tomorrow, someone like me teaching their children.,,,,,
HARRY,But Dumbledore...,,,,,,
LUPIN,Dumbledore has already risked enough on my behalf.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Besides,,,,,,
LUPIN,Well,,,,,,
LUPIN,Why do you look so miserable,,,,,,
HARRY,None of it made any difference.,,,,,,
HARRY,Pettigrew escaped.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Didn't make any difference?,,,,,,
LUPIN,Harry,,,,,,
LUPIN,You uncovered the truth.,,,,,,
LUPIN,You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.,,,,,,
LUPIN,It made a great deal of difference.,,,,,,
LUPIN,If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Now,,,,,,
LUPIN,So now I'll say goodbye,,,,,,
LUPIN,I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.,,,,,,
LUPIN,Until then mischief managed.,,,,,,
RON,Stand back,,,,,,
NEVILLE,Harry.,,,,,,
NEVILLE,Wherever did you get it?,,,,,,
SEAMUS,Can I have a go,,,,,,
SEAMUS,After you,,,,,,
HARRY,What are you talking about?,,,,,,
RON,Quiet.,,,,,,
RON,Let the man through.,,,,,,
RON,I didn't mean to open it,,,,,,
RON,It was badly wrapped.,,,,,,
RON,They made me do it.,,,,,,
FRED & GEORGE,Did not.,,,,,,
GEORGE,It's a Firebolt.,,,,,,
FRED,It's the fastest broom in the world.,,,,,,
HARRY,For me?,,,,,,
HARRY,But who sent it?,,,,,,
RON,No one knows.,,,,,,
HERMIONE,This came with it.,,,,,,
BOY 1,Go on,,,,,,
BOY 2,Yeah,,,,,,
HERMIONE,How fast is it,,,,,,
HARRY,Lumos.,,,,,,
HARRY,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.,,,,,,
HARRY,Mischief managed.,,,,,,
HARRY,Nox.,,,,,,
